 (clears throat)
 Where are you coming from, guy?
 (screams)
 I thought we were done with you.
 I thought we were done.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings,
 and today we're joined by Jeremy Renner.
 He's a two-time Oscar-nominated actor
 whose acclaimed credits include The Hurt Locker,
 Arrival, The Town, American Hustle,
 and I could go on and on.
 He has a pair of high-profile projects on the way as well,
 Hawkeye, season one, which premieres on Disney+
 November 24th, and The Mayor of Kingstown,
 a 10-episode American crime thriller
 coming to Paramount+ on November 14th.
 Jeremy Renner, you've been a very busy guy.
 Thanks for taking the time for Hot Ones,
 and welcome to the show.
 - Thank you very much.
 - How are you around spicy food?
 Like, what's going through your head right now
 as we prepare to dig in?
 - I feel like we're gonna compete or fight.
 - Okay.
 - That's what this feels like.
 I set up already, do something wrong,
 I'm gonna start swinging.
 - All right, well, I'm ready.
 I'm ready, I'm ready, Jeremy.
 - Yeah, I like spicy food, right?
 But I like to taste my food when it's spicy.
 It's supposed to just accent the food.
 I know as we get a little bit further along,
 it might be the opposite of that,
 but I'm always down.
 I'm up for the challenge.
 (dramatic music)
 (static buzzing)
 - Dom's sliding in some napkins for us, just in time.
 - A diaper.
 (laughing)
 - So this first one will be the garlic classic Fresno.
 - Yes. - Edition.
 - All right.
 Oh, wow.
 Mm-hmm.
 Delicious.
 - So one of your big upcoming TV projects
 is "The Mayor of Kingstown," a crime thriller
 that's set in the Rust Belt.
 What makes the show's creator, Taylor Sheridan,
 who directed you in "Wind River,"
 what makes him such a master of the modern,
 small-town American crime drama?
 - He's got a very specific, clear voice.
 He's pretty fearless in how he writes.
 He writes very specifically.
 What I love about Taylor Sheridan's writing
 is that it's as equally as intimate and beautiful
 and tender as it is violent and ferocious and shocking.
 In a lot of ways, but he doesn't do it for shock value.
 It's all about the truths of things,
 but he goes to the extremes of human behavior
 and in his storytelling with those sort of extremes.
 Okay.
 Yum.
 It's bliss.
 It's bliss, it's nice. - It's nice.
 - Yeah, I'm going for another one.
 That is bliss.
 - So in addition to acting,
 I know that you've acquired and renovated
 dozens of homes over the years,
 and in a 2014 interview with Larry King,
 compared building a house to the closest thing
 to producing a movie.
 Do you have a favorite wood?
 When Nick Offerman was on the show,
 he called white oak the most heroic of woods.
 - I mean, I used iron wood on the last house that I built
 'cause it's an exterior wood,
 and it goes after its name.
 It is like iron.
 It's hard to even put a nail or a screw through it.
 It's so dense, but it's great 'cause it's very lasting.
 - Do you have any foundational home decor advice
 that you think could be relevant to anyone
 from a college kid in their dorm room
 to someone vying for the cover of Architectural Digest?
 - Just because you like it
 doesn't mean it's good for the room or the whole scene,
 right?
 Maybe the 49ers poster's not gonna be
 the most appropriate thing for the living room,
 or whatever, the Fairfax poster, right?
 Think about the whole scope of the room.
 What does the room need?
 Center point, when you walk into a room,
 if it's a fireplace, whoever it is,
 it's gonna be the main focal point,
 and then work off from there.
 I always start with a neutral color palette
 'cause you can always add color,
 an art, and pillow or a throw, those kind of things.
 And then you mix elements with wood,
 then with water and fire, if there's a fountain,
 use iron, use fabric, just mix that,
 woods, all that kind of stuff.
 I think you have a good starting point from there.
 (upbeat music)
 The Hoffs, all right.
 Mm-hmm, this is my breakfast.
 (laughing)
 Thanks, Hoff.
 For now.
 - So as a movie star and gear head,
 can you share a Hollywood trade secret
 when it comes to the art of the chase scene?
 I once saw you post a picture, maybe from a Marvel set,
 where it looked like the whole thing was being diagrammed out
 with matchbox cars.
 - Oh yeah, it's what some of the stunt drivers
 and stunt coordinators will use to show other drivers
 and actors just to show the whole scope of the things,
 but they'll use, literally, these match cars.
 We did it on the Hawkeye show.
 There's a big sequence in there with vehicles,
 and you have to show what's going on
 and how it's all gonna run down, so no one's surprised.
 - Is that typical?
 - Anytime, in my experience,
 I haven't been in a ton of car stuff,
 but when there was and they were intense,
 it was all done with hot wheels.
 Yeah, pretty funny.
 (light music)
 All right.
 No, I don't even taste any heat on that one.
 - Well, enjoy that.
 - And then Chilo kicks in later.
 Wait about three minutes, you can't speak.
 - Enjoy that part of the show.
 - I am, trust me.
 - You know?
 - Trust me.
 - So if I only have an afternoon in Modesto,
 is it better to tour the McHenry Mansion
 or catch a Modesto Nuts game at John Thurman Field?
 - Wow.
 Your age, I would just say, just take the next exit.
 (laughing)
 Go on, go somewhere else.
 - Did you ever spend any time on the Modesto cruise route
 from Montgomery Boulevard to J Street?
 - Yeah, that was a very, very big thing in the community
 when you could actually cruise at the time.
 Now you can't, but back then it was a very, very famous thing
 and George Lucas and all that happening,
 it became a very popular thing there.
 It was the only thing that I did as a kid,
 we had a car on the weekend,
 just drive up and down McHenry
 and see all the cars and do the thing.
 And that was actually a fun thing to do,
 but then it got too ruckus and people were crazy
 and it disturbed the neighbors,
 so they'd shut it all down.
 - Do you remember your first ever play or local production?
 I was actually able to track down on YouTube,
 I think it's from 1990, you're playing the Scarecrow
 at the Modesto Community College production
 of Wizard of Oz.
 - Correct, yeah, yeah, that was the first job I ever had
 in theater or as an actor.
 I'm playing the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz
 and that was a really great experience, man.
 It also ran with no act break either,
 they decided to make like one long just run
 so the kids can really enjoy it
 and went to all the schools and invited them
 to do performances for them at the schools.
 And I still have a lot of the,
 all the kids sort of responses and stuff
 that they sent to us.
 It was really, really, really great.
 It was the first sort of step into like, you know,
 having to put smiles on kids' faces.
 That was a beautiful thing.
 This is, what, the Hotheads?
 - Yeah, Hotheads, revolutionary.
 - All right.
 (upbeat music)
 - Yep.
 - Little bit more of a kick, but nothing you can't handle.
 - Nothing too bad, but yeah,
 a little bit more kick on that one.
 (Jeremiah laughs)
 Fucking sadist.
 - All right, Jeremy, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We're doing a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll show you the picture over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 - Uh-huh.
 - This picture is nuts.
 What do you remember about the mechanics of shooting
 a mile and a half up the Burj Khalifa
 with Tom Cruise for Ghost Protocol?
 - Yeah, this is, when you're looking at, in this position,
 you look down and everything looks like little Legos.
 Even skyscrapers look like little Legos.
 If I fell out, I can make good two or three phone calls
 before I hit the ground.
 Saying, "Hey, man, you know, I'm out."
 I'm going down.
 Yeah, it was far.
 It was so high up.
 Gosh, who is kicking, bastard?
 Everyone else is harnessed in behind me.
 I had one guy just holding me with a rope
 on his regular old belt.
 And I'm looking back and he's on his cell phone.
 I'm like, "If he doesn't have me,
 "I'm gonna keep sliding out of the window."
 And I told him, Tom, I was gonna grab onto anything,
 so just be prepared 'cause I was pretty terrified.
 And I told this guy, I was yelling at him,
 like, "Make sure you have me before I commit to going out
 "'cause this is before I really went all the way out."
 'Cause my body was already, it goes like this, right?
 Here I can still hold myself.
 But our conversation was pretty funny there.
 - The safety net was a little questionable.
 - It was a little questionable, yeah.
 - How would you describe what it was like
 to hit nine Gs in an F-16?
 - Challenging, painful, like 13 elephants sitting on you.
 You have to work very, very hard not to pass out.
 And these guys can do it so easily.
 I have such admiration, respect for these pilots.
 But boy, it is a lot of effort.
 It is a lot of effort.
 - Speaking of trying not to pass out,
 you ready to move on here to the back half?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 We're already getting into it.
 This thing doesn't even have a nice looking label.
 - Yeah, that's how you get into that off menu back of house.
 - You mean just gonna fuck me?
 I already know.
 - Sign a waiver situation.
 - I already know, I already know.
 - This is the Senor La Chuga here in the six-pot.
 (laughing)
 - And the name.
 Yeah, that's not so bad.
 - You know, this one has a nice sort of like
 cinnamony kind of entry point.
 But then I feel like it kind of has that time release,
 slow burn situation.
 Yeah, I'm getting a little moist.
 Is that normal?
 - Totally normal, totally normal.
 This crew, they've seen some things over here.
 But careful around your eyes, that'll be the one thing.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not touching.
 No, no, trust me, you see me doing this.
 - I know, a vet, a hot sauce vet right there.
 - Yeah, you don't wanna put it in your eye.
 - So in speaking broadly about the roles that attract you,
 I've heard you make an interesting point
 about how you like to play suppressed characters
 because there's more internal nuance to figure out.
 - Yeah, when things are all spelled out for you,
 pretty on the page, it's all kind of out there,
 there's less room to explore.
 When things are kind of, you're forced into your hand
 into the creative process of understanding
 the character and behavior.
 Like, well, you can still talk a lot and do all these things,
 but when you don't know the intention behind it,
 there's the coiled spring.
 It's like characters like Jim in the town,
 or we're like, wow, is this a good guy or a bad guy?
 Or is he gonna kill me or give me a hug?
 I'm not quite sure.
 There's that underlying sort of coiled spring,
 something that's gonna come out
 and it's a very actionable thing.
 All right.
 - This is the Boutel of Fire.
 - Yes. - We're kicking it up a notch.
 - Right.
 This is all messed up, right, yeah.
 This is the one.
 All right, I'm ready.
 - The Boutel of Fire.
 - All right.
 Still tastes like chicken.
 It's a good sign.
 Little peppery, this one.
 Nice.
 - And speaking of the coil, you know,
 it has kind of that.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, that one.
 (grunting)
 - Ooh, yeah.
 I love it.
 - So whenever we have an actor as prolific as you,
 we like to fact check some of the folklore
 surrounding the project.
 - I'm totally listening to what you're saying.
 (laughing)
 - Is it true that you became--
 - I'm a sadist.
 (laughing)
 - Is it true that you became a quick study at card tricks
 and learned to spit fire when playing a street magician
 for your role in The Immigrant?
 (burping)
 - I can spit fire now, that's for sure.
 That one, I had to learn this dance routine,
 I had to learn all these magic tricks
 and slide a hand with hiding the cards
 and all that stuff.
 Now it's a fun departure of things
 that I'd done in the past,
 especially during those four movies prior.
 They're all like action stuff
 and just beating people up or getting beat up.
 This is actually just a really cool skill set
 and it's pretty much all I did for three days
 and I just got pretty decent at it.
 It was fun, yeah.
 - Is there any truth to the online rumor
 that you actually spent time with convicted bank robbers
 to prepare for your role in the town?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Well, Ben, only me didn't say that initially.
 He's just like, "Just hang out with these guys.
 "Just go hang out with them and they'll take care of you."
 And that's where I learned the accent and the thing.
 Then they were telling me I just gotta have a 20-year bit.
 I'm like, "What's a 20-year bit?"
 "20 years in prison."
 I'm like, "Oh, wow, what are you in for?"
 I'm like, "Well, aren't we car robberies
 "and that sort of thing?"
 "No shit."
 I'm like, "Yeah."
 And this guy is staring at me.
 He's like, "Oh my goodness, this is intense."
 But they loved me.
 They loved that Ben was part of the process.
 I wasn't really afraid,
 but these are guys that you kinda should be afraid of,
 but they're our allies, not enemies, so thank God.
 - That's important.
 - Yeah.
 - And then finally, is it true
 that your first ever paid acting gig
 was at a local police academy
 where you played the role of a criminal perpetrator
 for like 50 bucks a pop?
 - Yeah, yeah, there was a,
 they literally just put me in a closet
 and said, "All you gotta do is the police officer's
 "gonna come knocking on the door
 "and just don't do anything that they say."
 There was like, unruly, some disturbance or whatever.
 So I'm like, "Okay," and then they close the door,
 then officer comes in, he's like,
 "Again, action," whatever it was.
 And I'm just like pacing back and forth,
 huffing and puffing and screaming,
 "Oh, fuck you!"
 I'm going crazy.
 They're like, "Excuse me, sir," I'm like, "Fuck yourself!"
 They opened the door, I kick him right in the nuts.
 I think I went a little over the top.
 - But you know, look where it took you.
 Look where it took you.
 - Yeah, but I got paid, 50 bucks,
 and they brought me back.
 They did bring me back.
 - Oh, recurring role.
 - Yeah, yeah, they brought me back.
 - Yeah.
 All right, Jeremy, are you ready to move on here?
 How you doing? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine
 with one eye, but that's fine.
 Let's go for, I got one more.
 - Okay, there we go.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 (both laughing)
 It's great, I'm into it.
 I'm gonna get a decent sized one here tonight.
 - There you go, yeah.
 - Okay, I'm waiting for it.
 - Something serious right there.
 - I'm not gonna lick my fingers on it, but.
 What's this one called?
 - Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Yeah, yeah, that's fucking hot.
 - Story checks out.
 - Yep.
 - Isn't it with heat, in certain.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - God, in certain parts of your tongue,
 it gets hotter, right?
 - Yeah.
 - You keep it like on the tip, maybe it won't be so hot,
 but it's, I'm the dick that's just savoring it.
 - Right, yeah, I did see the way that, yeah, you kind of,
 it was like a. - It's hot.
 - Sniff of wine.
 - Yeah, this is hot.
 - The way that you kind of took that whole thing in.
 - This is hot, yeah.
 - But yeah, it's gonna.
 - I don't taste the chicken on this one.
 - No, that is out the window.
 - Yeah.
 - What's your lasting memory of off-road racing
 at the Baja 500?
 You know, my interest.
 - Look at her, hot, hot.
 Hang on, oh, I get swollen.
 - My interest was piqued when you said
 that you needed a kidney belt in order to keep your inside
 from getting slapped around too much.
 - I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
 What about a kidney belt?
 - The Baja 500.
 - Yes.
 - Of off-road racing at the Baja 500.
 - I got a co-drive and that.
 - Ah.
 - Woo.
 - Ah.
 - Let me just find some peace for a minute.
 - Let's just find it.
 - Yeah.
 Okay, I'm back on earth.
 - I'm with you, we're connected.
 - Yeah, okay, good.
 Yeah, co-driving, interesting race where it takes two people
 to drive a car, 'cause one person's job is just to steer
 and tell them the level of the turn is coming up.
 And you have to, yeah, you've got to strap in
 'cause you're bouncing all around.
 And my mouth is on fuego.
 Yeah, ready though.
 - I know that for many years, the Norton Commando
 is a prized possession in your garage.
 As a motorcycle enthusiast, how would you explain
 the holy grail status of that bike to someone like me?
 - Well, it takes like the cool factor of the original.
 Where are you coming from, guy?
 Ah, I thought we were done with you.
 I thought we were done.
 You're done.
 All right.
 - The Norton Commando.
 - What's great about the modern day one
 has all modern day technology,
 keeps the cool old factor of your bikes,
 but looks like it's a little bit on steroids,
 give it, you know, like it's been in the gym.
 So it's got a little beefiness to it,
 has modern technology, but still has a real cool old
 cafe racer styling, so that's why I love it.
 - Well, I'm sold, Jeremy, are you ready to move on here
 to the next wing?
 How you feeling?
 You look great.
 - Yeah, okay, ready.
 - Am I ready?
 This next one is--
 - This is not gonna help.
 It's not helping.
 - We're past that point.
 Hellfire's cranked.
 - That was awful.
 But yeah, I can taste the flavoring and the spices and that,
 and the other one, for whatever reason,
 just went right to, I don't like you.
 You know what I mean?
 - Is there a dive or karaoke bar that you missed most
 from your ignoble days, your early ignoble days
 in West Hollywood?
 - Yeah, there's a bunch.
 I mean, geez, that was so much part of my social life,
 just being broke and like, I'd go out and sing karaoke with,
 and that's where I met most of my friends,
 and heck, Amy Adams I met there, and Chris Pratt,
 met all those peeps in karaoke bars.
 There was like, Barney's Beanery was a big one
 we all went through, but all over, we went everywhere.
 - Jay Sloan's?
 - Jay Sloan's, another big one.
 Wow, we went there a lot.
 We just, in the half time, we were barely drinking.
 We'd just go out and sing,
 and 'cause I couldn't afford to drink or eat anyway,
 but you know, because we'd frequent the place so much,
 and because we could sing, we'd bring people in,
 and then they would buy us drinks and food,
 and so it was a great way to not starve as an actor.
 - All right, Jeremy Renner.
 - What are you doing with that one?
 (laughs)
 Why are you shaking it?
 We have to add to it?
 - This is the last dab, we call it the last dab,
 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing.
 You don't have to, if you don't want to.
 - Well, I mean, God.
 Why not?
 (laughs)
 Last dab.
 Doesn't mean you have to eat the last dab, do you?
 Oh, God.
 There is, I guess, a loophole there.
 - Yeah, I'll do it.
 Gone this far, right?
 - And crushed it, by the way.
 Whoa!
 - That's not a dab.
 It's still not a dab.
 - That is a smattering.
 - That's a slather.
 - It's a pure slather.
 - All right, we'll figure it out.
 - Respect.
 - Oh, God.
 - Cheers, Jeremy.
 What a ride.
 - Bad decision.
 (upbeat music)
 - All right, next one, kill 'em.
 You know it's all over my lips.
 - But the good news, Jeremy Renner,
 is that we are now at the latest
 in a long line of one degree separation
 from Jeremy Guest that we've had on the show.
 From your three-time co-star, Elizabeth Olsen,
 to your friend, Anthony Mackie,
 to Scarlett Johansson, who may or may not
 have actually stolen beer from your green room
 to quell the aftermath of eating the bomb beyond insanity.
 But I wanna narrow the scope
 on Hot Ones fan favorite, Paul Rudd.
 - Yes.
 - Now that you're doing press tours on a solo mission,
 what do you miss most about tag teaming junkets
 with your co-star and 50-year-old virgins?
 - Yeah, there's no one more fun to do just life with, right?
 I have so much man love for that guy.
 He just brings out the best in people, I guess.
 He's got just such a wonderful way,
 and then we just had like the strangest,
 most beautiful bond.
 Yeah, that was probably the most fun press tour
 that we had on a movie that we could say nothing about.
 - Right.
 - Right?
 That's why we just came up with the idea.
 Let's just talk about this.
 Why are we wearing each other's faces on each other?
 We had something to actually talk about,
 and that's what I talked about in Kimmel and all the shows.
 We could promote this movie that doesn't exist.
 We just had a good time doing it.
 It was awesome.
 It was awesome.
 - Well, Jeremy Renner conquering the wings of death today.
 Look at us.
 Look at us.
 Who would have thought?
 Not me, and now.
 There is nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you, my friend.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Fire.
 I have fire on my face, in my eye holes.
 Fire is going on in my life.
 Like right now.
 Hang on, sir.
 Check out Mayor of Kingston, November 14th.
 Check out Hawkeye, November 24th.
 See you at the ER.
 Ah, yeah!
 (laughing)
 - Woo!
 That's the Hot Ones experience.
 - Yeah, this is awesome.
 This is awesome.
 It'd be fun.
 Woo!
 My goodness.
 (laughing)
 you
 (Who am i.)
 (Who am i.)
 (Who am i.)
