 You just feel it all over your tongue.
 You feel it all over your tongue,
 you feel it in the back of your throat.
 That doesn't even sound right.
 Um.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First Weed Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we deliver you another Hot Ones reunion special
 brought to you by Pringles with Gabriel Glacius
 back in the hot seat.
 Today we not only have some new hot sauces
 on the table for you to try,
 but also some of our very own limited edition
 Hot Ones Pringles flavors.
 They're the go-to snack of summer
 and a dream come true for our little chicken wing talk show.
 Gabriel Glacius, welcome back to Hot Ones.
 What's going through your mind?
 Is he prepared to take on the gauntlet for a second time?
 - Oh, well, first of all, man,
 it's been a long time since I've been here.
 - Too long.
 - You guys have a budget now.
 (laughing)
 Thanks, thanks for the dressing room and the snacks.
 Your snack game is different.
 - Moving on up.
 - When I saw, yeah, 'cause before that,
 the last time it was just a vending machine,
 but now it's like whatever you want.
 I go, you sure?
 'Cause last time, like, yeah, it's a different game.
 But thanks for having me back.
 I'm excited.
 (upbeat music)
 - We'll start at the classic,
 and then we also have a classic Hot Ones Pringle.
 You can get these exclusively at Circle K stores.
 - So it's basically like a chicken wing chaser.
 - Yeah, we got a chicken wing chaser.
 We got the crisp with the chicken wing chaser over here.
 - Okay, so we're just gonna start with this.
 - We'll start with the crisp and chase it with the wing.
 - Here we go, chase it with the wing.
 (chicken wings crunching)
 - Okay.
 - Yeah.
 - That's actually pretty good.
 (laughing)
 - So I wanna start by congratulating you
 on your recent historic sold out performance
 at Dodger Stadium.
 As someone who respects comics
 who play to the back of the room,
 how is your approach as a performer different
 when you're playing a huge baseball stadium
 versus a small intimate comedy club?
 - I think the pacing of it.
 You definitely need to slow down
 and you need to take in what's happening.
 Whereas at a comedy club,
 everybody's so close to you
 that you have to just throw it out there.
 You know immediately if you're doing good
 and you know immediately if you're sucking balls.
 Can I say that?
 - Go ahead, let it fly. - Sucking balls.
 So, (laughing)
 in a situation like Dodger Stadium,
 I've been working on this set for like three years now.
 And so I was very, very, very comfortable with it.
 - You got to savor it a little bit,
 like the flavor over here.
 - Ah, see what he did there?
 See what he did there?
 Yeah, 'cause I'm not done with this one.
 (upbeat music)
 Adobo Loco.
 - Kind of a little island vibe.
 - Are we putting something on it or it's already been-
 - Already sauced.
 - Okay, ready, here we go.
 Mm, that's sweet.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - That's sweet, I like that.
 - It comes from Hawaii and has that island vibe to it.
 - I'm reading adobo,
 so something told me that maybe there's like a,
 something from the Philippines,
 but you're saying it's from Hawaii.
 Oh, there's a kick.
 (laughing)
 There's a, it's slow.
 It's slow, you should call this the fluffy.
 'Cause it, you know, you're like, nah,
 it's not gonna get, and then eventually enhancing it.
 Oh shit, yeah, he was there all along.
 (laughing)
 - So during your 2020 appearance
 on First We Feast the Burger Show,
 you took us inside your fluffy museum
 to show off what has to be one of the largest
 privately owned Volkswagen bus collections
 in the entire world.
 Is there something that you're proud to have added
 to the showroom in the time since we spoke to you last?
 A new toy, something.
 - (gasps) Hold on a second.
 - Yeah, take your time.
 - Yeah, I see.
 (laughing)
 Call it the lagger.
 (laughing)
 My friend Alfred bought me a Volkswagen thing.
 It almost looks military and the windshield goes down
 and it's like a convertible,
 but then it's like, it's a challenge to get in.
 They only made it for a couple of years,
 but everybody that sees it goes, that's freaking cool.
 'Cause it's so different.
 So I had one of those and I also added a Volkswagen Bug 16.
 - You saw the red one?
 - Yes.
 Oh man, that's nice.
 That's nice.
 It was actually intended for someone else.
 And they wound up not going for it.
 And I did, and now it's mine.
 So yeah, my win.
 - What's special about that car?
 Like what draws you to some of these toys?
 - First of all, I have to feel comfortable in it.
 You know, and the big question always,
 if people say, oh, you really fit in those Volkswagens?
 Yeah, what's a dig, man?
 (laughing)
 I'm a big guy, but the car, it's a car, you know?
 So yes, I fit and it's very comfortable
 and you just feel chill.
 It's such a relaxed ride, you know?
 And it's so old and yeah, you smell gas
 and yeah, there's no AC
 and yeah, the dogs are complaining.
 They're like, hey, where's the Beamer?
 I'm like, sorry, we're taking,
 (laughing)
 we're gonna roll in a Volkswagen.
 It's nostalgic, even though I wasn't part of that,
 that world way back in the day,
 for me, it's just a cool vibe.
 All right, so mescaline?
 - Mescaline. - Mescaline, here we go.
 (upbeat music)
 This one's kind of slow like the adobo,
 but I'm still feeling adobo.
 - So last time you were on the show,
 we discussed your love of wrestling
 and then to brag on your behalf,
 you did go a perfect 10 for 10
 on our wrestling catchphrase quiz
 that we did to close out the show.
 From your perspective as a comedian,
 who would you say was the funniest wrestler of all time?
 - Ooh, probably The Rock.
 The Rock always had singers.
 I think that The Rock would have been a really good comedian
 just because he's so comfortable with the microphone,
 he's very witty, he's very likable.
 So that's the first thing with comedy, are you likable?
 And he got away with saying some crazy things
 and no one ever got mad at him.
 He was just The Rock, that was just how he was
 and he was very quick on his feet.
 I remember when he was cutting promos with John Cena,
 Cena was good, but Rock was like, wow.
 And I'm just like, oh, I would not wanna get into
 a roast battle with The Rock
 even though I'm a comic,
 I still feel like The Rock would be like,
 well listen, he hit me with something.
 And I'm like, I can't say nothing, that's The Rock.
 (laughing)
 But yeah, The Rock definitely is probably
 the funniest wrestler.
 - Well, if you say it, then it's the truth.
 Are you ready to move on here to number four?
 - Number four.
 - Number four, and with number four,
 we have a Pringles crisp, Los Calientes Verde.
 - Can I get you to say the name again?
 - Los Calientes Verde.
 - See how he didn't try to sound Latino,
 he was just like, I'm white and it's high-five.
 I appreciate that.
 You weren't trying to pull out the high school Spanish.
 Los Calientes Verde.
 And then go back to be like, so listen, Gabe,
 you kept it real, I appreciate that, respect.
 Respect, okay, so this is Los Calientes Verde.
 - Scorching.
 - Okay, so this is, okay, this looks impressive.
 I'm excited.
 - For Los Calientes fans,
 the Verde is available at grocery stores nationwide.
 You can also grab Los Calientes Rojo Pringles
 exclusively at Walmart.
 - Should we do it like we did last time
 with the crisp and then the wing chaser?
 - Crisp and then wing chaser?
 - Wing chaser.
 - Unless you wanna freaking try to do this thing right here.
 - Oh, okay, I like this.
 - Is that kinda gangster?
 - Yeah, I like this.
 - All right, here we go.
 - A little crack of veneer.
 - Ah, that's gonna happen.
 Oh, shoot.
 I've never done that before.
 - Neither have I.
 Kind of a game changer.
 - That's got a really nice flavor.
 It's not too, it's not uncomfortable.
 You could feel the spice in it,
 but it's like, man, I want more.
 - From laundry mats to bingo nights
 to the literal back of a truck,
 what would you say was the strangest comedy venue
 that you ever performed in early on in your career?
 - Oh, that's easy.
 I performed inside of an empty swimming pool
 because the owner of the house,
 yeah, it wasn't always Dr. Stadium.
 I performed in an empty swimming pool
 that still had like a little bit of water left
 at the very bottom.
 And the owner's thing, the way he sold it was,
 look, man, we don't have a sound system.
 So you get in the pool
 and everyone will just stand on the outside.
 And this way, the acoustics of the-
 - The natural acoustics.
 - The natural acoustics.
 You know, everyone will hear it
 and it'll sound like a real big show.
 I was so young in the game.
 I didn't know what a bad gig was, what a good gig was.
 All I knew is they were gonna feed me and I had gas money.
 So I'm like, "Win."
 And I think it turned out well
 because I wasn't thinking about the situation.
 I was just happy to be working and happy to be performing.
 Yeah, that's a weird kind of orange.
 Okay, here we go.
 Wish me luck.
 That one had something, a little sweetness coming out.
 - Yeah, and then sort of like that deeper
 Reaper pepper comes through.
 But so far we're doing good.
 - I'm feeling this.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 This got a little magic on it.
 That's what you wanna call it.
 - But going in.
 All right, Fluffy, as you may recall,
 we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 Besides your recent performance at Dodger Stadium,
 what's your all-time favorite Dodger Stadium memory?
 - I got to, oh man, you know,
 and I don't wanna sound like a douche,
 but I got a few good ones.
 Throwing out a couple first pitches,
 I got to announce it's now time for Dodger baseball.
 I was there for a World Series game.
 - Tommy Lasorda, right?
 - Reaper, I got to meet Tommy Lasorda.
 I met him twice.
 One time it was in passing on the way out,
 and I think everybody was trying to meet Tommy,
 so it was kind of like, you know.
 But the second time he came to me,
 which freaked me out, and he's like, "Hey."
 And I'm like, "Oh my God."
 And I'm like, "How are you?"
 I was geeking out.
 I was geeking out 'cause I knew how, you know,
 I mean, it was an incredible moment,
 and I got a chance to meet the man,
 and I thought it was nice.
 It was very nice.
 It was not forced.
 It wasn't like, "Hey, Tommy, you gotta come meet this guy."
 "Oh, I gotta meet another."
 You know, it was very much he wanted to come say hi,
 which I thought was really nice.
 It was really sweet.
 And so that picture is actually on my wall.
 - I love that. - Oh, I'm burning.
 Freaking Reaper.
 Freaking Reaper's ruining this moment.
 I'm trying to stop it.
 That's so emotional.
 That was the Reaper.
 Oh, yeah.
 That was an interesting day.
 I was invited to be on his show.
 I'm trying to remember the name.
 - "Hot Boxing."
 - Excuse me, that's right.
 "Hot Boxing" with Mike Tyson.
 And so we get there,
 and I did not know that it was basically a dispensary.
 You know, that it was a, you know, so it's-
 - He's got a whole thing going on over there.
 - There's so many random things happening
 when you get there.
 And I could talk to you about, you know, that day for hours,
 but that moment right there, I thought that was pretty cool.
 That was after the interview.
 He was super nice.
 Mike Tyson's one of those people
 where I feel like he's, you know, polar opposites.
 So either he's like the sweetest, nicest,
 just very inviting and warm.
 And how are you feeling?
 You okay?
 Can I get you something?
 And then the other side is like, you're gonna die.
 - Yeah. - You're gonna die.
 But that was really cool.
 I love the fact that, you know, once the show was over,
 he could have just called it a day,
 but he stuck around and came over and said,
 "Hey, can I take a pic?"
 And he was like, "Yeah, take them."
 And I wanted to do a bad Tyson impression
 and then have him come looking for me.
 But yeah, we took that picture
 and that picture was also on my wall.
 That was a really cool day.
 - Iconic.
 You have a good wall.
 It sounds like you have a good wall.
 - You're on my wall.
 - No, I'm not on your wall.
 - You are on my wall.
 - Are you serious?
 - Yes.
 - I gotta see this wall.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - It's a big wall.
 (laughing)
 - All right, are you ready to move on down the lineup
 back half here?
 - You know what?
 I'm gonna get a little bit of water
 so that I feel like I need to reset.
 - Yeah, yeah, me too.
 Yep, yep.
 Take a little pit stop.
 - This tastes very different.
 - Yeah.
 - Mm.
 - It has like a collard green vibe to it.
 - Mm.
 That was good.
 - There we go.
 - That was not uncomfortable at all.
 That was very pleasant.
 I would eat that again.
 - It fell down to the bone too.
 Came to throw down on round two.
 - Yeah, a little delayed on that one.
 (laughing)
 I think I'm feeling the ghost.
 - I think that this is a good time to point out
 you've been such a friend to the First We Feast channel
 doing tacos con todo, the burger show,
 snacked not your second time on Hot Ones.
 And I'm curious, how does the guest experience--
 - I'm a lifer, bro.
 I'm a lifer.
 I'm in it to win it, man.
 - Blood in, blood out.
 How does the guest experience of doing Hot Ones
 compare to say doing the burger show or tacos con todo?
 - Well, clearly, I mean, in a situation
 with like the burger show,
 that was fun because we got to make the burgers together.
 - Yeah.
 - We're side by side, we're cooking,
 you smell and everything.
 It's like, it's the buildup, you know?
 Whereas like here, everything's already made.
 Everything's already out.
 We're already in this level versus, you know,
 I think if we were making the wings together
 and then we're mixing, so it's that buildup to this point.
 And with Trejo,
 we went to a Mexican restaurant that's in my hood,
 but it was different because normally when I'm at home
 at this restaurant, there's people coming by left and right.
 Whereas because we had production there,
 everyone was kept out and we actually just got to enjoy
 the restaurant by ourselves.
 And it was nice 'cause I'm noticing things on the walls.
 I'm like, "Oh, I never noticed that before
 'cause I'm always running."
 (both laughing)
 But a very different experience.
 Right now, my face is starting to feel something.
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - Me too.
 - We're going through some changes here.
 Physiologically, the walls are closing in on us a little bit.
 And when that happens, I think the only thing you can do,
 the only way out is through, as they say.
 - Keep going.
 - Just move on to the next wing.
 (dramatic music)
 - I don't know about you, but I'm not feeling a whole lot.
 - I would say that you're lucky because I'm catching.
 (laughs)
 That's the thing with some of these,
 when I see people doing these hot challenges,
 or it starts off and then people get very cocky.
 I remember when I was in Europe a few years back,
 there was a guy in the street
 who would sell these hot sausages.
 Now that was his thing.
 He'd sell these sausages and they would have
 the scorpion chili and another chili in it.
 And you had to sign a thing and you had to eat it
 in front of him wearing gloves.
 - Yeah. - It was this hot dog.
 And basically, I did a challenge with everybody.
 And I'm like, "Hey, oh, I'm feeling that now."
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.
 Sorry, messed up my own story.
 But I forgot what I was gonna say.
 - You were in Europe?
 You were eating the spicy sausages?
 - Yeah, everybody ate the hot dog.
 Wow, that's...
 (laughs)
 Yeah, that did it.
 - I don't want a burp on...
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 - Edit that out.
 (laughs)
 - On the topic of Europe,
 did you have a favorite sightseeing experience
 during your most recent Fluffy World Tour?
 It seems like you had a good time at the ruins in Greece.
 - You know, I've had the honor of seeing a lot
 of really cool things over the years,
 palaces and just landmarks.
 But going to Greece, I had always wanted to go to Greece
 and so much started there.
 And to see these, basically the Par...
 I wanna say it right, the Parthenons.
 I'm saying it correctly.
 Now the Greek people call it...
 - Just blame it on the sauce.
 - Yeah, blame it on the sauce.
 It was really, really cool
 because I've seen so many pictures over the years
 from the '50s and '60s and '70s of other entertainers
 that have gone to Greece and they all take the same picture.
 And I'm like, "Oh my God, I took the same picture
 right at the same..."
 You know, like I was watching
 the George Carlin documentary the other day
 when there's a part where George Carlin is standing there
 with his wife and they're right in front of it.
 And I'm like, "Oh, how freaking cool.
 I was right there."
 Like it was the exact same spot,
 which I thought was really, really cool.
 - This next one is "Da Bomb Beyond Insanity."
 And this is one that maybe you remember
 because it was actually around the last time
 that you were on the show.
 - So the last time I did the show,
 this one right here is the one that sent me home
 to a bottle of Pepsi.
 And yeah, I wasn't feeling this way
 the last time I got to this point.
 Excuse me, the last time I got to the...
 Marty.
 The last time I got to this point,
 I was still comfortable.
 Whereas right now, I'm still feeling the edges
 from the adobo and that curse I'm feeling.
 So this, I don't think is gonna go well.
 - Yeah.
 I'm like, "Look at the color of this one."
 - Can't throw a chip in there, huh?
 Pringles, where are you to save me?
 Okay.
 - Bye. - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 (dramatic music)
 - I know.
 (explosion)
 (groans)
 That is so uncomfortable.
 - I know, it's the worst.
 - That, oh.
 (groans)
 Do people finish the wing or is it just usually one bite?
 - Not usually on this one for obvious reasons.
 - This hot sauce is,
 there's nothing about it that,
 you just feel it all over your tongue.
 You feel it all over your tongue,
 you feel it in the back of your throat.
 That doesn't even sound right.
 (laughs)
 What show are you on?
 - Yeah.
 So earlier this year, it was announced
 that you'd be starring and producing
 in a Netflix project, "Ai Chihuahua",
 which combines three of your life's passions,
 dogs, wrestling, and cartoons.
 Under these distressing conditions,
 do you have a Mount Rushmore of animated shows
 like the top four cartoons of all time?
 - I'm not acting, this is, no, I'm very,
 look at my, my.
 - Yeah, and be careful, don't touch him, don't touch him.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Ah.
 (dramatic music)
 - Toy Story?
 Coco?
 - Just got, just sent out. - I'm blanking right now.
 - I know.
 - That's what it would feel like to eat COVID.
 (laughs)
 - All right, that, that's, yeah.
 If COVID was a wing and a sauce,
 I'd be right there.
 (laughs)
 Dingo Psycho Sauce.
 - Out of Australia.
 - All right, Dingo.
 Let's see what you got, mate.
 We're gonna go all day and end out here.
 All right.
 I'm still tasting the bomb.
 Given the venue, I think it's worth mentioning
 that you recently partnered with Tapatio
 for a limited edition fluffy hot sauce.
 Now that you've been battle tested today
 by this gauntlet today,
 what would you say distinguishes like a good hot sauce
 from a mediocre hot sauce?
 - Lack of pain.
 (laughs)
 For example, with Tapatio versus any of the sauces here,
 it's a very, very nice flavor.
 I feel like it makes the food taste better.
 It enhances the experience of whatever you're eating.
 - All right, Gabriel Glacius.
 This is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing.
 - Okay.
 - You don't have to if you don't want to.
 - Mine is sealed.
 - Go ahead and pop that, yeah.
 - You sure?
 'Cause I could just take this one with me.
 (laughs)
 If you could sign it, make it out to eBay.
 - I got it, I got it.
 I got you, I got you.
 (gentle music)
 - Here, bro, here, hook me up.
 - Here, gotcha.
 - Straight across the table.
 There you go.
 All right.
 - There you go.
 Came from the man himself.
 - Straight.
 - It was fun.
 - We're closing things out.
 And as we've learned today, from humble beginnings
 to selling out Dodger Stadium,
 you've scaled the heights of comedy.
 And I know that you have a deep appreciation
 for those who came before you.
 You've watched Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Sam Kenison,
 so many times that you can't even count.
 What's the quality in a standup that you admire the most?
 - How engaged they are with the people,
 the level of connection that they have.
 That's the most important thing because if you can't connect,
 and it's one thing to be entertaining,
 it's one thing to have a good show,
 but how connected are you?
 When people leave, how do they feel?
 Was it like, "Oh, I saw a good show,"
 or, "Man, so-and-so, dude, we gotta come back and see him."
 He was really, that one thing,
 when people are talking about what you were doing
 versus overall, I think that sets everything.
 So having that connection.
