 (laughing)
 - Oh God.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by James Corden.
 He's the 12 time Emmy award winning host
 of The Late Late Show with James Corden
 and he has a brand new project on the way as well,
 starring alongside Sally Hawkins
 in the dark comedy drama series Mammals,
 which is set to release on Prime Video November 11th.
 James Corden, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you for having me.
 - How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 - So I'm in for the challenge, plus I really like you
 and my son thinks that this is just like the coolest.
 He thinks there's nothing we've done on The Late Late Show,
 which even comes close to being as good as this
 in terms of viral moments.
 So when I told him, he was like, oh wow.
 But now I'm here.
 - And you can't escape it.
 - Yeah, I'm really, yeah, I'm genuinely quite scared by it.
 Scared by all of it.
 (dramatic music)
 See, I'm already a bit like,
 I'm gonna need more milk than that.
 - Don't worry, Dom's on it.
 - I'm aware that most people already think
 that that's just a wing.
 They don't think this is anything, right?
 - Well, you don't know unless you try it.
 Maybe this will be like your new favorite food.
 - Oh, that's fantastic.
 - That's what I'm saying.
 - That's great.
 This has been brilliant.
 Thanks, man.
 (laughing)
 Cheers, guys.
 I did it.
 I crushed it.
 Let's go.
 (laughing)
 (dramatic music)
 - So in Mammals, you play the role of Jamie,
 a Michelin-starred chef whose life begins to unravel
 when he discovers a shocking secret about his pregnant wife.
 What was the draw or pull
 for this particular project for you?
 Like, have you long been yearning for a chance
 to return to your dramatic acting roots?
 - The thing with this show,
 it's written by a playwright called Jess Butterworth, who--
 - Is a hero of yours.
 - Yeah, he wrote Skyfall and Ford versus Ferrari,
 the new Indiana Jones.
 He also has written his last two plays
 have won Tony Awards and Olivier Awards,
 a play called Jerusalem, a play called The Ferryman.
 They're the best nights I've ever spent in a theater
 watching those shows.
 And we actually met in New York.
 He said, "Look, I wrote this show a few years ago.
 "Could you do it?"
 And I read it, and I just emailed him straight back,
 and I was like, "Yes."
 I mean, it's the most excited
 I've ever been reading a script ever.
 Like, I'm so proud of it as a show.
 I really am.
 (gentle music)
 - I'm trying to watch how you're reading it.
 - Mm, let's see if I have any tricks.
 - And I notice you're trying to avoid some lip touching.
 Would that be fair?
 - Maybe, or maybe I'm like evening it out.
 You know, like front half,
 maybe work this side a little bit,
 left side, work this side a little bit.
 - You're working sides?
 Are you serious? - You know, 19 seasons,
 19 seasons, you learn the tricks.
 - You're working sides of your mouth.
 - Try not to tip there. - Like an NFL coach.
 - A balance attack.
 - You're like, yeah, you are. - It's a balance attack.
 - You're playing defense and then you're like, go, hit 'em.
 Wow, geez.
 Again, very pleasant. - Lovely.
 - Very pleasant. - So far.
 - So far, very pleasant.
 I would go so far as to say I'm having a nice time.
 - There we go, we'll see if we can keep it going.
 So from my understanding, Hot Ones and Carpool Karaoke
 have somewhat similar origin stories
 in that you knew you had something special
 the second that you uttered the name and the concept,
 but the real challenge began
 when you actually had to start booking it.
 What is it that publicists maybe didn't connect
 or didn't see about it in the original pitch?
 - It was everything, really.
 Like, I was so certain that we had a good idea.
 I just knew that like, ah, this makes sense.
 I get it.
 I'm sure the way that you thought about this,
 like, I remember reading about you saying
 that people open up in an environment
 where they're feeling uncomfortable.
 It's very difficult to keep your guard up
 when you're like, oh, and you're sharing something together.
 Like, I think this would be very, very different
 if you sat there and just got the guests to eat
 and you didn't.
 - Right, yeah, it'd be weird.
 - There's camaraderie in it
 that I can already feel when we're doing this.
 And so there's something about taking someone
 and placing them completely on their own
 in an environment that is so recognizable to us.
 We sing our lungs out in the car, along to the radio,
 and seeing someone doing something
 in the very same way that we do it,
 I think is quite humanizing.
 And I think that's what you've done so brilliantly here,
 is it's a very, very humanizing segment, you know?
 Now, which part of your mouth are you gonna work for this?
 - I'm bouncing over to the left this time.
 - Bouncing to the left. - Yeah, yeah.
 - I'm back left.
 - Smart.
 You know, I know that you're a rookie,
 but that's a veteran move right there.
 - I'm back left, watch this, watch this.
 - Whoa! - I'm back right.
 Yeah, yeah.
 - Allen Iverson crossover right there.
 - I'm back right.
 Just taking my first rodeo.
 - When we had Russell Brand on the show,
 he taught me the chant, "Up your ass, up your ass,
 "stick your blue flag up your ass."
 As a fellow West Ham supporter,
 do you have a favorite song or chant
 to scream from the terraces?
 - I actually had the experience,
 I think, of what it feels like to be a West Ham manager.
 I'd gone to Emirates Stadium
 to watch West Ham play Arsenal,
 and I was sat right above the West Ham fans,
 and one started chanting, "One James Corden."
 There's only one James Corden.
 And I was like, oh my God, I couldn't believe it.
 I was laughing, I was like,
 these are like, I used to sit with these people
 in like the lower Bobby Moore at Upton Park.
 I can't believe this.
 Then one of them said, "Corden, give us a song.
 "Corden, Corden, give us a song."
 And there's a back and forth song
 that West Ham fans sing about,
 "Oh, East London, oh, East London,
 "he's wonderful, he's wonderful."
 So we sung that, I started it, they chanted back.
 I was like, this is amazing.
 And then someone just went,
 "Corden is a wanker, Corden is a wanker."
 (laughing)
 And then they all started, I was like,
 whoa, that took a turn.
 That really should take a,
 and then one of them started singing,
 "Get your tits out for the lads."
 And I was like, oh wow, I really had a moment.
 I imagine that's what it feels like to be West Ham manager.
 You win three games, the fans are like, you're amazing,
 then immediately you're like, you're dead.
 And yeah, it was a lesson in just, you know,
 being, not taking everything with a bag of salt, you know?
 Los Calientes.
 Now you said that like it's turning up a notch.
 I'm again, working the back left.
 I see it.
 But so far you're doing good.
 I'm gonna try and David Blaine it.
 (laughing)
 I'm just gonna try and David Blaine it.
 I'm just gonna try.
 You know David Blaine was on our show last week, right?
 Two weeks ago.
 Same with ours actually.
 And I never, I never know what he's gonna do, the trick.
 'Cause I love the element of surprise of it.
 He enjoys that too.
 So he comes on the show and he just goes to me,
 "Do you trust me?"
 He makes me take out a hundred dollar bill
 and he lights it on fire.
 Pours a mug of water on the ash of the hundred dollar bill.
 And then he goes to me, "Drink it."
 So I drink it, right?
 I drink the whole thing.
 He then does the sketch.
 It's amazing.
 There's a bird comes out, lands on the stage
 holding a hundred dollar bill
 with the exact same security demos.
 And it's crazy.
 Soon as we go to break, he goes,
 "Dude, I can't believe you drunk that."
 (laughing)
 And our producer Rob runs up and goes,
 "You weren't meant to drink it.
 You weren't meant to drink the water."
 I'm like, well, give me a heads up.
 Nobody said.
 And I go to David Blaine, I go,
 "Am I gonna be all right?
 Am I gonna be okay?"
 He goes, "Yeah."
 He goes, "You know when you put a cigarette out
 on your tongue, it's no worse than that."
 And I was like, "Mm."
 Okay, 'cause that's a reference point
 that lots of people are aware of.
 You know, like, "Oh yeah, of course.
 Yeah, did it on Friday.
 Yeah."
 So I'm gonna Blaine it.
 - Blaine it.
 - Okay, here we go.
 I feel like we're about,
 I feel like we're in the change zone.
 I feel.
 Can I be honest?
 As a taste, that's delicious.
 You know, it set my taste buds alight.
 They're not lying.
 But they've put it on quite a low flame.
 You know, they've put it on a nice, it's a simmer.
 - Yeah, nice, pleasant simmer.
 - It's a slow roast.
 - Nice, slow roast.
 Nice, slow roast.
 - Yeah, we can put this on, leave it all day.
 The meat's gonna fall off the bone come 6 p.m.
 - All right, James, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guests' Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So I'll show you the picture over here on the laptop.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Laptop, please.
 Thank you, Bill.
 - You're welcome.
 - I mean, I think it is worth saying
 that I almost never post on Instagram.
 - Yeah, actually, side note, we went into the Getty's
 'cause also they're easier to clear and post.
 But that's a hot one secret, all right?
 That's host to host, all right?
 - I gotcha.
 - Don't you worry about that.
 - Do you remember the moment that gave you
 the biggest adrenaline rush while ripping through the sky
 in a '40s era fighter jet flown by Tom Cruise?
 - I do.
 So Tom called, and you know, it's Tom Cruise.
 So he just goes, "James, listen to me.
 "I am never, ever gonna put your life in danger.
 "You just gotta trust me."
 You know, it's all like that.
 And what was amazing, and what he did say
 that really did put me at ease was he said,
 "The reason we have to do it now is I'm flying every day.
 "I'm completely match fit."
 The most terrifying bit, he just went,
 "Okay, you ready?"
 And I was like, "For what?"
 And I can't remember what he called it,
 like a death roll or something?
 Where basically the plane just goes,
 or should I do it with the wing?
 - Yeah, there you go. - The plane goes,
 it's you're here and you're up this way,
 and it just goes like this.
 Whoa, and twists, and you're like falling to the earth,
 and you can see the earth, and you're in an old plane,
 so it's really hot, and you can't help but just go,
 (screaming)
 then he pulls you back up, and like,
 and he's of course just cracking up,
 'cause he just thinks this is hilarious.
 There was a lot going through my mind when I did it.
 A lot of it was like, if something happens, bad,
 for the rest of their lives, my children might be somewhere,
 and people will go, "Do you know who that is?"
 Their dad killed Tom Cruise.
 But that would be the takeaway.
 My death would just be irrelevant.
 It would just be the fact that I, it's 'cause of me.
 Segment from my show, I killed the greatest movie star,
 perhaps of all time, and they would have to live with that.
 (dramatic music)
 See, it even smells a bit different, no?
 Okay, I'm going in.
 (dramatic music)
 There's no chewing strategy that works at a time like this.
 It's just all out of tact now.
 (laughing)
 Okay.
 Okay, I see what you do here.
 You lulled me.
 Yep.
 (coughing)
 Oh, God.
 So since the 1950s, hosting a network TV show,
 I think was a job that most people considered
 a lifetime appointment, but that's obviously a thing
 of the past with multiple hosts in the last couple of years,
 including yourself, announcing imminent departures.
 Do you have a take on the endless ink spilled,
 the conjecture and questioning
 about the future of "Late Night"?
 You know, historically, the slot that I'm in,
 that 1230 slot, has been like students,
 stoners, insomniacs, night shift workers.
 That's your key demographic.
 As far as I can work out,
 all of those people are still watching things.
 They're just not really reaching for the button to go,
 "What time is it?
 "We should put that on."
 And I think this probably happened before I started,
 the late show was starting to happen.
 I've certainly felt it happen while we're doing it.
 The nature of them has changed,
 whereas what it used to be was like,
 this was the only place you'd ever see
 these huge stars as themselves, you know?
 And now, like, you can open your phone
 and you can see some of the biggest stars in the world
 in their house, talking to you from their kitchen.
 So suddenly, the notion of a talk show
 has somehow removed that,
 that ax, where you're adding an additional step.
 Well, you're like, "Well, that's not,
 "I just saw you in the gym, walking down a road, you know?
 "I've seen you, you're most human.
 So it's a tricky thing as like a,
 well, of course, I'm like a traditional talk show host
 to sort of think about and combat.
 Whereas I think something like this feels
 completely organic, 'cause I think it came
 from a really organic place of what you wanted to do.
 You know, look, it used to be,
 how many networks were there in America?
 Four, three?
 It's now, there's just all of these places
 to try and sell whatever it is you're trying to do,
 you know?
 And it's a very, very interesting time
 in that sort of traditional linear television,
 'cause I still think it has value.
 It's just, I don't know, trying to figure that out,
 I think is a bit of a minefield, I do.
 Karma source.
 So does that mean it's karma for things
 that my mouth may have done in the past?
 (laughs)
 Perhaps.
 Okay, well, let's hit the disco.
 That's too much, I hate this thing, all right.
 All right.
 Wow.
 I'm just looking in the eyes.
 That's so stupid.
 I know.
 And now it seems like such a distant memory,
 when you were like on the first three wings,
 and you're like, oh, this is actually very pleasant.
 I can't swallow it, I can't swallow it.
 Nice, I know.
 You're not letting me swallow it.
 My body's going, don't do this.
 I know.
 My tongue's going, get rid of it.
 Go ahead.
 Whoa.
 You got it though.
 Somehow, some way.
 Frozen in time.
 (laughs)
 (laughs)
 I know.
 That's a base.
 So in the carpool karaoke episode,
 featuring Paul McCartney, it dropped.
 I know, I know, I know, I know.
 We actually sent it around to all of our team,
 because it was inspiring to see
 what probably went into that episode on a production level.
 Was there anything in that episode
 you remember fighting for,
 even though it seemed impossible to pull off?
 Oh, everything.
 See, I'm glad you've reached for the milk.
 That makes me feel better, because look where I'm at.
 I know, I know.
 I'm trying to keep up.
 I'm trying to keep up.
 Fuck.
 It was tough to get him to do it.
 You know, he was in, he was out.
 Brilliantly, he said, okay, fine, I'll do it.
 And he said to me, I don't want to go in my house.
 I don't want to go in my house.
 I haven't been in there since I left,
 when I was, I think it was 18 or 19.
 And I just remember going to him.
 I just said, Paul, your only day's work today
 is to have a great time.
 If you don't want to go in your house,
 we will, of course we won't go in your house,
 but let's not rule it out now.
 Let's see how we feel when we get there.
 And if we get there, and you don't feel comfortable,
 you're not having a good time, you don't want to do it,
 give me a look and I'll drive on and I'll take the blame.
 So you can actually see it on the bit.
 I go, should we, should we go in?
 He goes, yeah, why not?
 And we go in and I'll always be really, really proud of that
 and incredibly grateful to Paul
 for taking a leap with us, really.
 - And speaking of going for it.
 - These segues you've got, these segues you've got,
 I know that you think they're charming, they're not.
 They're getting annoying.
 And speaking of shitting your pants,
 let's move on to this.
 Okay.
 I never get used to this one either.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my fuck.
 I know, I know.
 I got you doggy.
 - I know.
 - So you performed at the National Theater.
 - How can you pretend like this isn't happening?
 How can you just go back to performing
 at the National Theater when-
 - So I always just kind of think-
 - And my mouth's telling me I'm going to die.
 - Right, right, I ignore the absurdity of this show.
 - That's a good idea.
 - That's how I approach it.
 I just always approach it as if
 we're not even eating wings.
 I write it as if we're not eating wings.
 Exactly.
 - None of us in here.
 We're all dust.
 We're all dust.
 Is this even happening?
 Maybe we're just a simulation.
 My tongue doesn't know what's happening to me.
 That's the best way I can describe it.
 - Confusion and chaos.
 - My tongue is sending messages to my brain saying,
 I think you should go to the hospital.
 - Right, right.
 - And my body's going, don't be silly.
 None of us are even here.
 We're all dust.
 - So you performed at the National Theater,
 hosted a late night talk show,
 and were even appointed an OBE.
 But do you ever think that your greatest
 cultural contribution might have been
 Smithy's Indian takeout order in Gavin and Stacey?
 - It might be.
 Certainly to some people, yes, for sure.
 - Do you remember the order?
 - Prawn Boona, Chicken Boona, Lamb Boona,
 Lamb Boona, Chicken Boona, Prawn Boona,
 Keema Naan, mushroom rice, bag of chips,
 and nine Pappadoms.
 Is that it?
 Yeah, that's it.
 - What's a--
 - And then we're all just gonna,
 whoa, hang on, why?
 Wait.
 Why have we all got a,
 why are we all just,
 because it's nice.
 No, it's not, not for me.
 'Cause I can guarantee,
 I can guarantee somebody here,
 probably Stacey, has ordered a Korma.
 Am I wrong, Mick?
 Am I wrong?
 No, you're right, actually, she has.
 Right, and that's pointless to me.
 It's futile, 'cause I won't touch it.
 But I can guarantee that Pete
 is already thinking about my Boonas.
 Pete, have you thought about my Boonas?
 Well, yeah, right, but they're my Boonas.
 If you want a Boona, order a Boona.
 No, I've had enough of it.
 It's the same when I went out with Chinese
 and his business last week.
 They're all digging into mine,
 going, "That's really nice."
 Yes, it is, that's why I ordered it.
 In fact, forget it, I want no part of it.
 I'll order my own and I'll eat it in the car.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, one of my, it's so much fun.
 Yeah, I'm surprised I can remember that much.
 Unique.
 Garlic.
 Oh, geez.
 I'm really trying to pick it up.
 I know, now it's like we're coming up with tricks.
 You know?
 I'm chewing very fast, is what I've realized.
 Like I've taken quite a lot of cocaine.
 Jaw's going.
 Let me tell you about my dad.
 (laughing)
 So hang on, this is 19 seasons.
 How many episodes a season?
 12 episodes a season.
 And the early ones, we did like,
 we had one, like season two was like 55 episodes.
 We were just like, it's nuts.
 'Cause they remember what it was like to work on it.
 All of, like, those are my day ones.
 Those are all my day ones.
 You know, it's like they've been along
 for this entire journey.
 And like season two, we just were like,
 we gotta turn out episodes, we gotta turn out episodes.
 It's like, we just gotta hit, we just gotta hit.
 We just gotta hit.
 Arriving every Wednesday, every Wednesday is an episode.
 Exactly, exactly, hit that same time, 11 a.m.
 So that the audience becomes conditioned to like,
 know that at this time, like this is what you, whatever.
 So we were just like, let's run it up, run it up, run it up.
 And the idea, we went through a similar thing with our show
 where we would just try, like,
 I think we've done 1,150 shows.
 I think we've done 65, 70 carpools, something like that.
 But we went through a stage of like,
 let's try and do as many as we can.
 And then as soon as it got to a point, it's like,
 okay, well now we just need to kind of protect it.
 Try and keep it in some rarefied air.
 I get it.
 Uniquely.
 All right, James Corden.
 The last dab.
 The last dab.
 Nice shake, good fundamentals right there.
 Good fundamentals.
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 Fuck you, Sean.
 Oh.
 Cheers.
 To you, James.
 Hang on, and now how much of this?
 Like that?
 Too much?
 But we're here.
 Okay.
 I wonder who I'll be after this.
 Right, it's a transformative baptism by fire.
 Yeah.
 Born again, out of the hot sauce.
 To you, James Corden.
 I gotta tell you, in case this does kill me,
 not immediately, but tonight,
 I'm absolutely loved every single second of this.
 You're so good at this.
 You're so brilliant at it.
 And everyone was like, it's cool,
 Sean's gonna take you through it.
 I was like, okay, it's completely right.
 You are absolutely brilliant at this.
 You should be so proud of it.
 Thank you, James.
 And speaking of being proud,
 I know you walked in here having no confidence in yourself,
 but look at you taking on the wings of death
 and still on your feet.
 And only one more question before we close things out.
 What I wanna do is draw a connection
 to this experience right now in your memoir,
 May I Have Your Attention Please,
 where you begin every chapter
 by giving out the precise atmospheric conditions
 in order to optimize the read.
 So if someone is watching this episode
 of Hot Ones with James Corden,
 do you have in your mind a best musical accompaniment?
 I do, I absolutely do.
 There's a song, I'd either listen to it before or after.
 It's called Go Easy Kid by Monica Martin and James Blake.
 I think it's the best song of the year.
 There's the refrain says, go easy kid.
 It's only rock and roll.
 And at the end of the song, they say,
 go easy kid in 20 years kid,
 you're gonna look back and wish you grabbed it all
 by the throat and said, fuck it.
 It's only rock and roll.
 Mike, drop and look at you,
 James Corden taking on the wings of death,
 living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 I have a new show, it's called Mammals.
 It's on Prime Video, November the 11th.
 (dramatic music)
 I'm as proud of it as anything I've ever done.
 And, you know, none of us are here, it's all dust.
 (laughing)
 (clapping)
 You did it.
 That was such fun.
 Did you have a good time?
 - It was amazing, I absolutely loved it.
 Thank you so much.
 (dramatic music)
