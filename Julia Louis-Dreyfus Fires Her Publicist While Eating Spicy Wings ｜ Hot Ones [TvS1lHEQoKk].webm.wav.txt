 I don't know why anyone would subject themselves to this.
 This show, by the way.
 Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans, and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
 She's one of the most decorated figures in television history,
 a recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor,
 as well as 11 Emmys for her work across Seinfeld,
 The New Adventures of Old Christine, and Veep.
 She also stars in the new Nicole Hollif-Center-directed
 dramatic comedy You Hurt My Feelings in theaters May 26.
 Julia Louis-Dreyfus, welcome to the show.
 Well, thank you.
 Do you mean it, though?
 How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 I'm not-- I like a little bit of spice.
 So I'm guessing this is not going to work out well for me.
 Well, there's only one way to find out.
 Are you ready to get started?
 Yeah.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 You don't have a spit bucket or anything.
 Oh, you should do.
 We do.
 Yeah, we actually do.
 Good.
 We've got a lot of stuff going on over there.
 Well, are you going to eat it, too?
 I'm right here with you.
 Cheers.
 Cheers.
 Cheers, Julia.
 Uh-huh.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Yeah, that's pretty good.
 There we go.
 I like that.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Yeah, here comes a little burn, but it's good.
 That's the classic hot sauce, ladies and gentlemen.
 [LAUGHS]
 So in your new film, You Hurt My Feelings,
 you play the role of Beth, a novelist who overhears
 her husband giving harsh feedback to her latest book,
 forcing her to question not only her work,
 but also her relationship.
 Yes.
 The film marks your second collaboration
 with director Nicole Hollisenter.
 What is it about her style of storytelling
 that makes her such a sought-after director?
 Well, I think Nicole Hollisenter's voice
 is a unique voice in filmmaking.
 She really knows how to straddle both comedy and drama
 at the exact same time.
 And she also is an amazing writer of dialogue.
 And her exploration of relationships
 are profound, actually.
 I'm going to tell you, my lips are burning from the first one.
 OK, so this is some other one.
 Yeah, yeah.
 The other one, we have a Curry Verde here in the two spot.
 OK.
 And I'm assuming these all just go up in hotness.
 Yeah, that's exactly how the show is designed.
 [LAUGHS]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 I don't think this is much hotter than the first one.
 OK, did you like hot sauce before you started this show,
 or did you learn to love it?
 I learned to love it.
 I learned to love it.
 So when we first started the show,
 I don't think we thought we'd be programming it.
 I think we thought it might be kind of a quarterly Super Bowl
 like internet event.
 Oh, yeah.
 You know what I mean?
 But then once it started happening,
 you kind of buy into the concept.
 And then all of a sudden--
 Ka-ching, ka-ching.
 Ka-ching, ka-ching.
 Ka-ching, ka-ching.
 And you know how it goes.
 And then here we are 21 seasons later still doing it.
 Still doing it.
 It's unbelievable.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, it's been a grind.
 But to answer your question, I had to learn to love hot sauce.
 But now I do.
 But now I do.
 From A Day in the Life of Joe Egg to Three Penny Opera,
 is there a student production that you did while at Northwestern
 that you think disproportionately shaped you
 as a young performer?
 Uh, bleh.
 I would say-- Jesus Christ.
 I would say that--
 I'm thinking because I feel like my brain, I'm like,
 you're jumping back to college.
 And it's hard for me to remember.
 But I did an improv show while I was at Northwestern
 called The Meow Show.
 Yeah.
 And that was the show that changed my life dramatically.
 Dramatically.
 It was born out of making fun of The WaMu Show, which
 is pretty straightforward sort of musical comedy review
 kind of a show.
 And I'm not dissing it in any way.
 But Meow was like just a parody of it in a sense.
 It was born out to be sort of a anti that.
 OK.
 Yeah, this got a little more burn.
 I can feel that.
 But I'm fine.
 I see it.
 Everybody relax.
 [LAUGHTER]
 You know, I was supposed to do this show three years ago.
 I know, with Will Ferrell.
 With Will Ferrell.
 Uh-huh.
 But I was really sick.
 Really sick?
 You know, because that's always the thing when you do it,
 you know.
 No, no, I mean, I was truly sick.
 So you're very lucky I didn't come on your show.
 [LAUGHTER]
 So earlier this year, you launched Wiser Than Me,
 a podcast where you talk to icons like Carol Burnett, Jane
 Fonda.
 How would you describe your general approach
 to these conversations?
 And what, if anything, did you learn
 from being on the other side of the interview?
 Ah, you know what?
 It's hard.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Do you find it hard?
 I like being on this side of the table
 rather than your side of the table.
 All kinds of people.
 Have you been on the other side of the table a lot?
 Yeah, I have.
 And why don't you like it?
 I feel a responsibility, like I got
 to keep the tent up or like the ball up in the air, right?
 But you don't feel it now because you should feel it now.
 That's what I feel now in this seat.
 I like that.
 But when I'm a guest, I also feel that.
 And then how annoying is that as a guest?
 You know, that's what I'm saying.
 Yeah, but I feel it too as a guest.
 Oh, OK.
 Yeah, I feel enormous responsibility.
 Well, let's just both take our foot off the gas.
 Yeah, fuck it.
 You know, who cares?
 Who cares about this?
 Whether it's Jane Fonda's life review method or Amy Tan's vow
 to do things that scare her, including swimming with sharks,
 is there a piece of wisdom that you've
 soaked up to this experience that you've
 then applied to your own life?
 No is a complete sentence.
 I like that very much.
 It's a really good one.
 I think it's a good one, especially for women,
 if I may be so bold as to say that.
 I think women have a tendency to apologize too much.
 And-- or apologize, I should say, inappropriately.
 And then-- by the way, I'm so sorry if I'm--
 no, I'm kidding.
 [LAUGHTER]
 And then Ruth Reichel was talking
 about the critical importance of doing things that really
 do frighten you, that maybe you're not quite even prepared
 for in certain circumstances.
 And that was--
 I think that's good advice under--
 in certain situations.
 Right, like if you're not so much of a hot sauce person,
 then here you are taking on the world's spiciest wings,
 for example.
 Exactly.
 And of course, you could make terrible mistakes.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 This is a little bit like going to a wine tasting,
 in the sense that it all tastes alike.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Mm.
 Why did I take such a big bite of this?
 Because you're brave.
 Yeah.
 And you're facing the things that you fear.
 I'm facing the thing.
 This is getting too hot.
 [LAUGHTER]
 OK.
 Mm-hmm.
 That's a little hot.
 Yeah, now we're moving away from wine pairing a little bit.
 And we're just into, like, waterboarding or something
 like that?
 [LAUGHTER]
 Gasoline tasting, you know?
 Gasoline flight.
 So for my money, "Veep" is one of the great ensemble
 comedies of all time.
 And I'm really intrigued by your research process
 to take on the role of disgruntled vice president
 Selina Meyer.
 Was there a job inside the Capitol that's
 maybe not always available to the public eye
 that you found to be especially intriguing or absurd?
 There's the role of the scheduler.
 And I think that's kind of amazing.
 I remember that we were talking to the scheduler
 of a particular senator.
 And she was saying that she sleeps--
 she was saying this with pride, OK--
 that she sleeps with her cell phone on the pillow next to her
 in case her senator needs her in the middle of the night.
 Oh, that sounds bad.
 I didn't mean it like that.
 But in case there's an issue because he's
 in different time zones, et cetera, et cetera.
 And she said it boastfully.
 I thought that was amazing.
 Yeah.
 OK.
 I'm taking a little bite this time.
 OK.
 A little shoulder shrug, no problem.
 I don't think that one's an issue.
 But I feel like I'm going to get screwed by these guys, right?
 Right.
 I think so.
 Yeah.
 I think so.
 And that's just me being honest with you, you know?
 Yeah.
 Just being honest with you.
 No, I appreciate honesty.
 You know, and I'm-- yeah.
 I'll let you know.
 I'll let you know when we get to sort of the dorm room
 prank region of the show, which is coming up.
 But in the meantime, Julia, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 And then you just tell us the bigger story.
 Oh, god.
 From the perspective of someone who fears horses,
 what was it like to shoot a scene with a horse?
 Terrifying.
 And you know what?
 This fucking horse knew I was scared of it.
 It did, really.
 It did not want to come near me.
 It's interesting.
 It's like backing away.
 And I was just--
 And you were backing away.
 I was very uncomfortable.
 Yeah.
 Although I will say, I think the jodhpurs and the boots
 and the jacket are pretty--
 It is a look.
 It works.
 It works, right?
 One more for you.
 After three plus decades in the entertainment industry,
 what was the most novel movie magic experience that you've
 had so far on a Marvel set?
 This.
 And the reason is that if you've seen Wakanda Forever,
 the scene that I'm in is meant to be on a bridge in Boston.
 And that is the bridge.
 And you can see how much green screen is everywhere.
 It's all CGI, the entire thing.
 And-- oops, sorry.
 And if you--
 I was watching and thinking, god, this is incredible.
 I mean, we were just on pavement in the middle of Atlanta.
 Yeah.
 The things they can do.
 It's crazy show business.
 [LAUGHS]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 The spicy shark.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 It starts off kind of nice, almost kind of pumpkin-y.
 And then-- yeah.
 And then that happens.
 Right, right.
 I do not care for that.
 I do not like that.
 I get it.
 Yeah.
 I get it.
 I don't know why anyone would subject themselves
 to this, this show, by the way.
 No, but why would anyone eat that?
 You know, some people are wild, as I
 think you'll find a little bit further down the line.
 But you're doing great.
 You're doing great.
 I am doing great.
 Thanks.
 [LAUGHS]
 So I was once reading an interview with Jason Alexander
 where he remarked about how tiny the Seinfeld set was,
 saying, if we knew that we were doing a series for nine years,
 you would never build that set.
 Elaine Venice is obviously a very physical character.
 Do you have any memory of being challenged
 by the square footage, the dimensions on set?
 Oh, boy.
 Well, yes.
 What we were always challenged by was,
 as soon as you walk into the apartment,
 what are you supposed to do?
 What business am I going to find to do in this apartment?
 And you're not just going to come in and sit
 on the couch every time.
 You had-- oh, that's right.
 We-- I mean, you had the couch.
 You had the kitchen.
 And then you had that sort of the sweet spot.
 We kind of-- I think we called it the alleyway, which
 was sort of between the counter and the couch.
 And that was where a lot of stuff happened.
 It felt like you could hold court there in a way.
 But you also had to figure out what you were going to do,
 which is why I often would go to the refrigerator
 and just find things, or even just go and look
 in the refrigerator and not do anything, but just--
 it was-- we were limited.
 But we had to be creative about it.
 Yeah, it was interesting.
 What's it called?
 Jalapeno Chico?
 Chico.
 You go first.
 All right, I will.
 All right.
 Is it always the same ones?
 So each new season, believe it or not,
 during the 21st season, as I enjoy this one,
 we go out with the old and with the new every time.
 So this will get its 12-episode run, you know?
 This sauce.
 I'm not going to like this at all.
 I know.
 And you know immediately.
 And you know immediately.
 It's just awful.
 Mm-hmm.
 How-- how would panier chico--
 OK, yeah.
 What's the point?
 What's the point?
 I think like this.
 Do you not want to taste food anymore?
 I mean, it's just--
 Flame.
 No, that one I know is going to be a motherfucker.
 I can tell looking at it.
 By the way, are you allowed to swear on this show?
 You can let it fly.
 Oh, OK.
 You can let it fly.
 You can let it fly.
 OK.
 So I've had the opportunity to ask a lot of actors.
 I'm actually sweating.
 It's OK.
 It's OK.
 I'm sweating.
 You know what?
 It comes down from me too.
 You know, I get a little head high off of it.
 We're going to come out of this just completely different
 people.
 Yeah, OK, go ahead.
 OK.
 Do you have like a very specific internal barometer
 to be able to decide whether or not something's going to be
 funny, or is it always just a leap of faith?
 Oh, I have a barometer.
 Yeah, I have an instinct for--
 I mean, that sounds arrogant, actually,
 because I don't mean I always know.
 But I have an ear for it, and I have an instinct for what
 is funny, like on the page.
 [SNIFFLING]
 [LAUGHTER]
 But by all means, let's talk more about my career.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I'm firing my publicist.
 Not the first time I've heard that.
 I also want a lawyer now.
 How do you get rid of this spicy in your mouth
 after all of this?
 Is there any way to do it?
 Or is it like I'm permanently--
 Not permanently.
 --disfigured?
 No, no, not permanently.
 Not permanently.
 It's going to suck, but then in like 15 minutes,
 you'll forget it even happened.
 You know what I mean?
 Miserable experience, lovely memory.
 OK, you take a bite.
 All right, I will.
 Not to psych you out, right.
 And you'll know immediately.
 Yeah, that's not great.
 I know.
 The worst.
 OK.
 Oh, yeah.
 Right.
 OK.
 Yeah, laugh.
 Laugh, all of you laugh.
 That's fine.
 Oh my god.
 Yeah, all right, go ahead.
 Ask me another question and quick.
 All right, so when we had Nick Kroll on the show,
 he called Oakwood Apartments, which you lived in--
 I lived there.
 --a year after you left SNL.
 He called them one of the sadder places in the world.
 What was your experience like living in that famed
 haven for struggling actors?
 Sad.
 It was not great.
 Oh.
 Oh my god.
 I really-- I'm sweating.
 This is crazy.
 Yeah, it is.
 It is.
 It is.
 OK.
 Are the next two going to be worse?
 You remember how I've been honest the whole time?
 No sauce.
 No, no, no, no.
 No sauce is as hot as the sauce that you just ate.
 I say that in my long storied history with hot sauce.
 OK, well, we've got you on film saying it.
 You know, it's the worst hot sauce I've ever had in my life.
 And I think it'll be the worst hot sauce that you ever
 have in your life, if that's at all comforting.
 OK.
 I don't know.
 What did you just ask me?
 The apartments.
 The apartments.
 Yes, the Oakwood Apartments.
 They were sad.
 Yes, not great.
 I lived there for a couple months during what
 they called pilot season, which I don't even
 think they have anymore because everything's so whacked.
 But you know, I'm still dying.
 You know, I know.
 I know.
 I know.
 Is this supposed to get it better?
 It just-- you know, I think--
 I mean, this looks disgusting.
 I know.
 I get it.
 I didn't even pour it in a storm, you know?
 You have one milk mustache.
 I have one?
 Now you don't.
 Good looking out.
 Thank you.
 I got your back.
 I got your back, Sean.
 OK.
 And I got yours.
 You know, I haven't had milk in a long time.
 That's pretty tasty.
 Did it take you back?
 It did.
 And just in time for the next hot sauce.
 This is the watermelon ghost.
 OK.
 You go.
 I will go.
 I'll go first.
 Oh, you took a big bite.
 Look at you.
 I know.
 I don't know why I did that.
 Immediately a mistake.
 OK, no turning back.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Here we go.
 There we go.
 Now no fun.
 Kind of strange.
 But after the bomb, see?
 Yeah.
 OK.
 There we go.
 As a longtime champion of the cause,
 what would you say is the most underrated national park?
 Oh.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Um.
 What is the most underrated national park?
 There's Crater Lake National Park.
 But I've never been there.
 So how do I know?
 But it's on my list.
 I have a list.
 And it's on my list.
 It's really cool looking.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 I am not going to do what you just did.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That I think is for the best.
 And don't you worry about it one bit.
 Oh, I'm not worried at all.
 OK.
 So here we go.
 Cheers.
 Cheers.
 Oh, that has bite immediately.
 Right, but the good news is--
 the good news is, Julia Louis-Dreyfus--
 What?
 --the wings of death are behind us, OK?
 Yeah.
 We have kind of a--
 I know, I know, I know--
 a low lift obstacle here to close things out.
 Oh my god.
 In reading interviews with director Nicole Hollisenter,
 it's clear that she has a special place in her heart
 for your facial expressions.
 I also read that she brought a fart machine to the Enough
 Said set.
 And you and James Gandolfini would
 compete with each other for who could make the funniest
 face while using it.
 But that's a different conversation
 for a different day.
 And a different skill set, I might add.
 All I'm going to do is point to a sauce,
 and you tell me what it was like to eat that sauce only
 using facial expressions, OK?
 OK.
 The bomb beyond insanity.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 The classic chili maple.
 And the last dab of Apollo, the one that you just ate.
 [BELCH]
 [LAUGHTER]
 And there you have it.
 Julia Louis-Dreyfus taking on the wings of death
 and living to tell the tale.
 Now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet
 for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 Well, hello, America.
 [LAUGHTER]
 My movie, You Hurt My Feelings, is in theaters
 starting May 26.
 Please do enjoy.
 [APPLAUSE]
 That was fun.
 Thank you so much.
 I do not care for hot sauce.
 Hell, I don't care.
 Set it in stone.
 The verdict is in.
 The verdict is in.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 But you did so good.
 You did so good.
 I did do so good.
 I was a little scared.
 You have to be proud of yourself.
 Well, yeah, kind of.
 There you go.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Whew.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans.
 If you've ever watched Hot Ones and wondered to yourself,
 how hot are those sauces, really?
 I could get through that with no water or milk.
 Well, now is the time to put your money where your mouth is.
 The Hot Ones season 21 lineup is now
 available in its entirety at heatness.com.
 Heatness.com.
 That's heatness.com to get your hands on the season 21 Hot
 Ones hot sauce lineup, milk not included.
 Be careful around the eyes and get them while they're hot.
