 - This is like, I mean, I've had three children.
 (laughs)
 That's crazy.
 - Yeah.
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Kate Hudson.
 She's an Academy Award nominated actress
 and entrepreneur with a portfolio that includes everything
 from King Street vodka to her beauty
 and wellness products within Bloom.
 You can also catch her in the long awaited follow-up film
 Glass Onion, a Knives Out Mystery,
 which will be available globally on Netflix December 23rd.
 Kate Hudson, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you.
 I'm excited.
 Scared.
 - You're a little scared.
 - Nervous.
 Lots of anxiety. - How are you
 around spicy food before we get started?
 - Terrible.
 Terrible.
 I'm probably gonna be one of your worst spice peeps.
 I don't recognize any of these
 and that's 'cause I don't even have them in my house.
 - Well, it's time to explore the world, you know?
 - I'm gonna explore this and I hope I can get through it.
 I'm gonna try my best.
 I'm gonna try my best.
 My kids will be proud of me.
 - Of course.
 That's all we can ask.
 Are you ready to get started?
 - Sure.
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 - Oh God.
 This is gonna be the real test of my abilities.
 Beautiful.
 (upbeat music)
 That feels pretty good.
 - There you go.
 There you go. - Yeah.
 - So I wanna start by complimenting the film.
 I actually love the Knives Out movies,
 Glass Onion in particular,
 as I think they scratch an itch
 that has otherwise been kind of neglected by Hollywood.
 What did you mean when you said,
 "We need more movies like this."
 And I'm just so grateful I get to be in this one.
 - Well, I think that the theater-going movie is new.
 This new theater-going experience is dying.
 I mean, our industry is hurting there
 and it's movies like Glass Onion that bring me hope
 that maybe we can reinvigorate
 not only the theater-going experience,
 but people taking chances on what is a crowd pleasing film.
 Because it's one thing if it's Marvel,
 you know you're gonna get that event movie,
 but to go in and have a completely different movie experience,
 something that isn't in that world,
 is so important to our industry.
 Well, that's hitting a little harder.
 This is lippy.
 - Yeah, this is a lippy.
 - Yeah, it definitely feels like, you know,
 like those plump lip glosses that all us girls love.
 - Yeah, free treatment right here.
 - That's right.
 - After the Hot Ones set.
 - Did you see my lips after the Hot Ones?
 - How, if at all, did working an apprenticeship
 at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts,
 how did that shape your appreciation for acting?
 - Oh, I love that question.
 You know, when I was, I was still in high school
 and my mom was like, "You're too boy crazy.
 "I'm shipping you off to Williamstown Theater Festival."
 And I was like, "What?
 "No!"
 You know, it was like that age
 where all you wanna do is be with your friends.
 And I loved working on my craft,
 but like that was dedicated for the school year.
 Like this is my summer, you know?
 I had no idea what it was.
 I didn't know what she had signed me up for.
 My mom had actually given me my independence
 as a young artist and discovering what that is.
 And that, I mean, it was just the greatest experience
 of my teenage life.
 - Your mom was right.
 - She was so right.
 - Do you remember your literal like first ever production?
 Like what was on the marquee outside
 the Santa Monica Playhouse in the early 90s?
 (laughing)
 - The first time I was ever on stage, I was a little girl.
 I played little Alice in Alice in Wonderland.
 And I do remember my mom saying
 she's never seen anything bigger in her life
 than that little Alice.
 (laughing)
 I led with my chest.
 She was like, it was like all chest, you know?
 What if I'm great at this?
 What if I'm like the best person you've ever had on this?
 - I think that's where this is going.
 - Really?
 I don't think so.
 - I think so.
 I can see it.
 I can see it already.
 - This is interesting.
 Maybe my kids have prepared me for this a little bit
 'cause they do make me try things.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Like really aggressive spice.
 - I was talking to Bing before this started.
 - Yeah.
 - You know, he's young, but it seems like he's started.
 - Oh no, Bing is one of those.
 I have to be like, okay, no.
 This just can't be good for your stomach lining.
 We're still developing, Bingo.
 (laughing)
 - Is it true that during production for Nine,
 Daniel Day-Lewis would send you notes
 on custom stationery from the perspective
 of his character Guido?
 - Yes, from Guido.
 It was the best.
 And I remember, you know, I had the best of Daniel.
 I remember Leonardo DiCaprio saying to me,
 not to drop any names.
 - Drop that.
 - But Leo said to me once, like, how is Daniel?
 You know?
 And I was like, ah, the best.
 He's like, really?
 And I was like, oh yeah, you had him on Gangs of New York.
 I was like, you got that, Daniel.
 I got Guido, you know?
 I mean, it was like the juxtaposition of like,
 you know, your arch nemesis who's trying to kill you
 versus the man who's trying to sleep with you
 are two very different Daniel method actors.
 And yeah, I would show up to my dressing room
 and have notes from Guido.
 You know, Stephanie, you were wonderful yesterday.
 You know?
 And I was like, this is like, when I die,
 my children are gonna, like, this is, my grandchildren,
 this might live on, you know?
 - Will live on.
 Will live on.
 - If I can find them.
 Los Calientes.
 - I like this one.
 I actually really like this one.
 - Wow.
 Love that. - Is that weird?
 - No, we actually make it, so I love that.
 - Oh, really?
 (laughing)
 Is this yours?
 Oh my God, it is Hot Ones.
 - So that's why I was just soaking it in.
 - 'Cause it's got a little sweet in there.
 But it's like, this is, this is.
 - Look how good you're doing.
 - I'm gonna sell your product right now.
 It does have the perfect spice.
 Yeah.
 And it's a little sweet and it's got, it's good.
 This is good.
 - So when you launched your craft vodka line,
 King Street Vodka, you called it
 the most on-brand business you've ever done.
 Do you have a signature cocktail for the holidays?
 And if so, can you talk us through how to make it?
 - I made just recently what I'm calling a Goldie's Mad Dash.
 - Oh, this sounds good.
 - I made a lychee martini and I did two ounces vodka,
 two ounces lychee,
 an ounce of the cranberry,
 and then I did a dash of orange bitters.
 - That sounds nice.
 - And it's so good.
 And something my mom loves.
 So I called it Goldie's Mad Dash,
 which also is her personality.
 I just love a good drink.
 And in the winter, I love my, I love my bourbons
 and I'll have a whiskey.
 - Yeah, me too.
 - The fire, the cozy by the fire drink.
 This one looks ominous.
 I think the texture is not my favorite.
 - Yeah.
 - It was just a little too oily.
 But if I was eating pizza, I might like that.
 What is going on?
 I am five in.
 - And it's like, yeah.
 - I haven't even touched my milkshake.
 - Yeah, I know.
 I've noticed.
 I've noticed you haven't touched the milkshake.
 - Am I pregnant?
 Hold on a second.
 Does anyone have my flow calendar?
 This is weirding me out.
 - I think, you know, you just set the bar too low.
 - Okay, is that what I did?
 - You just set the bar too low.
 - I'm gonna get fucking crazy in a second
 is what you're saying.
 - I'm not gonna lie to you Kate.
 - I'm just gonna get fucking crazy.
 Got it, okay.
 - But in the meantime, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor
 and you just tell us the bigger story.
 - Okay.
 - How big a thrill was it for you to share a mic
 live and in concert with Bruce Springsteen?
 - The biggest thrill of my life.
 That was the best moment ever.
 You know what, sometimes when I'm feeling low,
 I like go, I Google that picture.
 I'm like Kate Hudson, Bruce Springsteen, you know,
 like just the fact that I can Google those two names
 together and that comes up is like,
 it's like I could, you know, it's like, that's it.
 You know, I've died and gone to heaven.
 I did this, I did a show where I presented,
 it was a charity function.
 And at the end, everybody was supposed to go out on a stage
 and like sing, don't stop believing, you know.
 I'm kind of singing to myself and Bruce, I see him,
 it was like out of the, it was like out of the
 Courtney Cox video.
 - It was like out of the music video?
 - Yeah, he was like, and I kind of like, me?
 I was like, is he pointing at me?
 And he goes, come sing.
 And I was just like, I am not gonna, yeah,
 if Bruce asks, I shall arrive.
 Yes, you know, and he just brought me on the mic
 and we started singing together.
 And I was like, I literally got in the car
 and I like, welled up like, 'cause it was just so,
 it was just amazing.
 That was just the best.
 I'm such a huge, huge fan of his.
 So that was pretty awesome.
 Love turmeric.
 - You like it?
 - Anti-inflammatory.
 - We'll see if you still like it.
 - Definitely.
 - Yeah.
 - Definitely.
 - New level.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Has some like sharp edges, I feel like with this one.
 - It's prickly.
 Like a little cactus.
 - Yeah.
 - Different level together.
 - But it's not like the heap, oh shit.
 You wanna know what I did once?
 - What?
 - I went to China for Kung Fu Panda
 and they sent me to Chengdu, which never in my life,
 if you showed me where Chengdu, I like it though.
 It's like clearing.
 I'm in Chengdu visiting the pandas
 and it's the Szechuan place, I think it's Szechuan.
 So we went and had, this is really, this has heat.
 Now I know where we're going.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Woo!
 Oh, and it's like that.
 It like keeps going.
 - Waves, right.
 - Yeah.
 (inhales deeply)
 - When you went to China, what was the culinary highlight?
 - I had a tofu dish there that I still think about.
 You know?
 - Yeah, well I always like, when I'm following you,
 that's what I kind of pay attention to.
 It's like you had that like Tokyo trip
 where you were like having breakfast with sumo wrestlers.
 - Yes.
 - Takazawa, doing like tasting menu stuff.
 - Oh, I love Takazawa.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - That was really sweet.
 You know what I--
 - You like crush your food adventure.
 - I love food.
 Yeah, I mean, and I'm one of those that takes pictures of it.
 I like, I could do, I sometimes I'm like, you know,
 in another like life of mine, somewhere in my head,
 I am doing a food blog as well.
 You know, I could just travel the world.
 I want to travel the world doing a food show.
 That would be the most fun ever.
 - Well, hey, let's talk after this, all right?
 - Yeah, we'll talk.
 (both laughing)
 (dramatic music)
 Cosmic Disco sounds like somewhere I've been before.
 (laughs)
 (sighs)
 - Let's do this.
 (dramatic music)
 - Right away.
 - Yeah.
 - Right away.
 - Yeah, and it has kind of like a sweet barbecue thing,
 like a little bit upfront, but it hits so hard.
 - Yeah, not great.
 - Just a beat later, yeah.
 This actually--
 - Not really my favorite one.
 - Remember when I told you about the throat scratch?
 - Yeah, thanks.
 - And you're like, oh, is there gonna be a throat scratch?
 Like, this is such a throat scratch.
 - This is what happens at this Cosmic Disco.
 (both laughing)
 That didn't happen at the one that I went to.
 (laughs)
 - Wow, it's called Karma Sauce.
 - Yeah.
 - 'Cause it's funk and hot.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - As Catherine Hahn would say, "Funk and hot."
 (laughs)
 Did you really eat that?
 - I did, I did.
 I'm right along with you over here.
 - Woo-hoo!
 - I know.
 - Wow!
 Oh my God, how fun.
 (both laughing)
 I'm gonna stay so positive,
 you're not even gonna know what, how, how that happens.
 - Okay.
 - So we had your "How to Lose a Guy in Fools Gold"
 co-star Matthew McConaughey on the show.
 - Oh, how is he with this?
 Am I beating him?
 - You are, you're doing, you're beating him.
 - I am?
 - You are beating him. - That's all I care about.
 I wanna take Matthew down on this one.
 No, I bet he was great.
 - He talked about the hallmarks of a good romantic comedy.
 What to you distinguishes a good rom-com
 from a mediocre one?
 - An actually good story.
 I mean, let's start with that.
 Like I think that sometimes people think
 rom-coms are all about that kind of
 (imitates air whooshing)
 the meet-cute.
 (both laughing)
 Hold on.
 Let's have a conversation like this.
 I feel like it's like a great rom-com.
 It's about meeting love, discovering love,
 falling in love, love falling apart,
 and then how you come back together.
 That's a very traditional rom-com structure.
 The ones that we love are like two movie stars
 and a love story.
 And that, you know, that they're shiny
 and they're bright and they are,
 that's like wish fulfillment.
 And it's supposed to make you feel fuzzy.
 And then they stay with you forever.
 They're the most classic.
 But just because they're supposed to feel bright
 doesn't mean they need to look so bright.
 So, you know, a lot of times I think that, again,
 the genre gets kind of dumbed down
 because they think they know.
 And then the chemistry, you know.
 So I'm grateful that it was me and Matthew
 because he's a blast.
 I feel like I'm really winning at this
 description of rom-coms.
 - Yeah, that was like an amazing,
 yeah, it was actually like, yeah, dissertation.
 - Thank you.
 It's the class I'm gonna be
 at NYU film school.
 And when I'm 75,
 I'll be the professor of rom-coms.
 Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - And that's just kind of like immediately.
 - Woo hoo hoo hoo!
 Wow!
 - It's a different level all together.
 - I'm so sad.
 I've had three children.
 That's crazy.
 - Yeah, and then just be careful around the eyes, you know?
 - Yeah, don't touch.
 - 'Cause you touched the eye, yeah.
 - What about my nose?
 Okay.
 - We mentioned your beauty and wellness company,
 Embloom in the intro.
 For the uninitiated like me,
 like what are adaptogens and nootropics?
 Like how would you even explain that
 to like a dummy like me?
 - Why are you asking me that question right now?
 Wow!
 Does this ever end?
 Does it end?
 - It does, like however you're feeling.
 - Like immediately, immediately like, huh.
 You know, like as bad as you're feeling right now,
 it's just gonna get easier from here.
 You know what I mean?
 Like the worst is kind of over with every passing second.
 - Wow.
 - Yeah, you go up, you go up.
 Amazing, amazing.
 - Is this like, this is what I look like
 if we go out in a fight.
 I'm like, it's okay, it's okay.
 - Let's say I'm hosting the show in 25 years.
 Like, is there a way for me to do this show?
 But like, I wanna look like Rob Lowe.
 You know what I mean when I'm doing it?
 - Like every man wants to look like Rob Lowe.
 Well, it depends on what you need and what you want.
 - Skin.
 - Beauty aura, collagen.
 We loaded it with vitamin C
 and that helps the collagen absorb.
 The come down's interesting.
 It's like, bad acid trip.
 - Yeah, you know what though?
 - Not that I've ever had one, son.
 (dramatic music)
 - Okay.
 I'm going in.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah, here it comes.
 But it's really nice.
 - Right, especially compared to the last one.
 - I feel like I can't feel anything anymore.
 - Yeah, it's just all scorched earth.
 - Is it just numb?
 - Numbed out, right.
 - Is it supposed to be getting worse?
 - You're good, you're good.
 Don't take yourself out.
 As you've survived, you're doing good.
 - I'm fucking killing it.
 - You're crushing it.
 I told you this whole time you've been crushing it.
 - I am shocked at myself.
 - I know you are, I know.
 But you should be very proud.
 You're so brave coming in here thinking like,
 you're just gonna get--
 - I thought I was gonna be the worst person in the world.
 - You said, you all but guaranteed it to me.
 But here you are, look at that.
 So on the Sibling Revelry podcast,
 you and your brother Oliver explore sibling bonds
 and family dynamics with other siblings.
 And I actually hired my brother Gavin
 to help out with the research on this show.
 Do you have any foundational advice
 on how to maintain a working relationship with a sibling?
 - Yeah, don't work with them.
 Honestly, all on, all like,
 all like, just now that I've--
 - Bared your soul and yeah, born again.
 - Feel like opened up.
 That has been one of the most rewarding
 working experiences I've ever had.
 And I wouldn't, oh, just somehow regurgitated.
 Just from the bomb.
 - Just when you think, you know, yeah,
 just when you think when you're in a--
 - The bomb just regurgitated back into my throat.
 - And into your life.
 - Yeah.
 You think you know your sibling.
 Those times I have with Oliver,
 it's brought us so much closer.
 I also find it really hard when you're interviewing people
 and they don't have that sibling relationship.
 They have that fraught.
 They long, they long to be close to their sibling.
 And even when they've had to heal it,
 or even when they've had to realize
 that it's not good for them
 and they can't be in that relationship,
 and they've had to heal that,
 they still write in and tell us how important it is
 for them to hear a good relationship with a sibling.
 You know?
 - Love that.
 - Yeah, oh shit.
 What are you doing?
 This is yours.
 Where is this going?
 Are you pouring it on yours?
 The last dab.
 - The last dab.
 - Oh, this is gonna be brutal.
 - All right, the last dab.
 Is that too much?
 - No, no, that's good, that's good, that's good.
 - Cheers. - Cheers, Kate.
 - Cheers.
 This has been an absolute pleasure and a blast knowing you.
 My last bite, my last meal.
 - I am, what has happened?
 I'm amazed.
 I'm aghast.
 I'm humbled across the table.
 All right, Kate Hudson, we've reached the end.
 We are at the end.
 I promise it is all almost over.
 I know, look at you.
 - What just happened?
 - You're no selling the last dab.
 - Are you so proud of me right now?
 I can't believe it. - Look at that big smile.
 - I can't believe this.
 - Look at that smile.
 - I'm shocked at myself.
 - I'm not, I knew, you know, when you said you couldn't,
 who was here to say that you could?
 - I do feel this in the back of my tongue.
 - And that you would, right.
 And it does kind of, you know, have that heat thing,
 but you know what?
 You've already eaten it.
 It's done.
 You've conquered the gauntlet
 and just one more little hurdle
 before we roll credits on this show.
 So close things out.
 Just a question.
 I'm not gonna bring out any more wings.
 But I wanna close with a quote that you said
 about one of your most iconic characters,
 Penny Lane from "Almost Famous."
 You said, "I like characters who can cry
 "and laugh at the same time.
 "Can you unpackage what you meant by that
 "while your brain and mouth slow roast in hot sauce?"
 - You mean what I did?
 What I did on the show?
 What you just witnessed?
 It's like, life is beautiful.
 It's one of my favorite movies.
 To be able to laugh through tragedy,
 find that life force in sadness.
 In "Fool's Gold," there's a scene,
 there's the beginning when you see me in "Fool's Gold,"
 I'm crying, laughing in a mirror,
 and I'm kind of taking everything out,
 and I'm doing it, and like,
 I couldn't wait to do that scene.
 You know, it was challenging.
 Those aren't easy things to do,
 and so that's fun as an actor,
 when you get those opportunities.
 - Well, look at you, Kate Hudson.
 Walked in here, said I'm gonna be the worst guest
 you've ever had on this show.
 Walk out, dabbing the last wing, and taking a bow.
 - I'm so happy. - Now there's nothing
 left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 (laughing)
 - Yes, I am, listen, I hope you guys all saw
 the "Glass Onion," a "Knives Out" mystery
 in theaters this past weekend and week.
 But if you haven't, it's coming out on Netflix
 December 23rd, and I can't wait for you to see it,
 'cause it's a total blast.
 (clapping)
 Thank you, this is so much fun.
 (clapping)
 - You did it. - I did it!
 I can't believe it.
 - I can, I knew you would.
 - This is like, I'm gonna, this is the only thing
 I'm ever gonna have bragging rights about.
 (laughing)
 It's like, you know, it's like, this is it, this is it.
 I made it through.
 Can you believe it, honey?
 Do you wanna try the Da Bomb?
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
