 Why does anybody do this to themselves?
 I don't know.
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Anita.
 She's a global pop music icon, one of the most decorated and influential artists on the planet.
 But first and foremost, she's a girl from Rio and she's returning to her Brazilian funk roots
 with brand new music inspired by the favelas where she grew up.
 The latest single is "Funk Rave" and the rest of the new music is coming soon.
 Anita, welcome to the show.
 Thank you.
 How are you?
 Or maybe not.
 I know, we can revisit that question here at the end.
 But before we get started, how are you around spicy food?
 I don't think it's going to be a nightmare.
 I told my family, oh guys, so back in Brazil, they're all in Brazil,
 I sent a link of the show and I said, I'm shitting in a show.
 And they're like, no, you're not, you're never going to be able to do that because they know me.
 And I say, yeah, I'm doing it.
 They said, why?
 I said, my PR said it's amazing.
 So I'm going to obligate my PR to eat with us.
 Well, you know what?
 Today, Anita, we're going to prove them all wrong.
 Are you ready to get started?
 No, but let's go.
 [MUSIC]
 I'm feeling like I'm pretending I'm on a date, the first date.
 Oh, okay.
 That doesn't matter what happens, you just pretend it's all good because you want to do good for the partner.
 That's what I'm pretending now.
 And I'm here for support too, all right, it goes both ways.
 So this first one is the classic chili maple and then you'll start at the handle over here.
 Okay, it's this one.
 Yeah.
 Not that one.
 No, no, don't, not yet, not yet.
 I'm crying for the first one.
 [MUSIC]
 It's already bad.
 [MUSIC]
 It's fucking burning.
 Can I say bad words?
 Be yourself on the show.
 It's my first time.
 So I understand that baile funk music was illegal up until like 2009.
 What was it like to be like a literal outlaw performer, you know, doing these shows, this art form that at the time was criminalized?
 Yeah, so what happens is like in Brazil, the rhythm, so Miami bass, Africa bombata, these rhythms in Brazil, they were all in English or other languages, whatever.
 And in Brazil, they wanted to understand what was going on.
 So they would do their own version in Portuguese and they would add the beats in like to sound more Brazilian swag.
 So it was like the girls just want to have fun in Brazil.
 It was judo, sem premia, there's like the Brazilian version of it with a funk beat in the back, more like Miami bass vibe.
 But they would change a little bit.
 The artists, they would sing about what happens in the favela and then the government would get pissed and blame it on the rhythm.
 While in reality, you should change the reality of the people there, give us opportunity, give us structure.
 So we would sing about other stuff, you know?
 I told my dad I was coming.
 He sent me a bunch of amaroids, medicines.
 That's a good dad.
 I'm going to get amaroids tomorrow.
 Okay.
 So this next one's the Curry Verde here.
 So I'm intrigued by an experiment that you did on a trip to Mexico where you asked the taxi cab driver to take me to a nightclub where the rich people hang out.
 And then later that night, take me to a club where the poor people go.
 I'm curious, what did you learn, observe during that experience? And then follow up question, which nightclub played the better music?
 The poor people.
 I mean, I come from a poor origin.
 So for me, it's always more fun, the urban nights, 100 percent.
 So I just went to Mexico and everything went wrong in this business trip.
 And I was like, you know, fuck everybody.
 I'm just going to realize what's going on alone.
 And then it was super boring.
 The fancy one.
 People were just like this.
 And I was like, Jesus Christ, we can't do shit.
 So then I left.
 I said, okay, now take me to the poorest one.
 And then it was just reggaeton and people were dancing, having fun, hot guys, hot girls.
 It's like, this is my place.
 So I started to Shazam all the songs.
 And then I went to the hotel.
 I searched about all the singers and everything.
 There was J Balvin, everybody.
 I started to text everybody on Instagram.
 It was great.
 And then I started everything because I loved it.
 Lemon pepper.
 I never put lemon on my food.
 First time, mom.
 Mom, I'm going to put Brazilian subtitles on this.
 Okay.
 This is the easy, this is easy.
 The easiest one from them.
 Why didn't we start with this?
 First one kind of caught you a little bit.
 Okay.
 Oh, good.
 Okay, guys, I'm so relaxed now.
 Yeah.
 There was no need to be nervous this entire time.
 There was this date I went once.
 Tell me about it.
 And the guy said, oh, I'm taking you to my restaurant, right?
 I was like, oh, okay.
 And he ordered for me.
 It was so bad.
 I was hating everything.
 There was so much.
 I don't eat black pepper, right?
 Mm-hmm.
 Everything had so much black pepper.
 And I don't eat it because I know it causes hemorrhoids.
 Me and my dad, we go crazy.
 And then I was just eating and I said, oh, I'm so full.
 I was like, oh, you don't like the frisbee?
 I love this restaurant.
 It's amazing.
 It was his restaurant.
 Imagine if I would say like, oh, it's bad.
 Terrible, terrible food.
 This chicken is better.
 We'll take that.
 We'll take that all day long, all day long.
 Okay, good.
 Let's go.
 Oh, God.
 Are we eating again?
 That's how the show works, for better or worse.
 Okay.
 Now, this one's a step up.
 So I'm curious how you absorb this one.
 Yeah.
 So good?
 Uh-oh.
 I feel like the guy at the black pepper restaurant right now.
 Oh, there's chocolate there.
 Ghost pepper.
 So good, guys.
 I love it.
 So I'm a big fan of your song Veneno and then the gorgeous musical video accompaniment
 that I think gives a real like body and shape to the songs more stimulating qualities.
 In the great tradition of creating songs to make love to, are there any essential ingredients
 like what in your opinion makes for like a great bedroom anthem?
 I love songs to make love.
 I always do songs to twerk, but I love the songs to make love is so good.
 And the music video have a scene from Veneno me with the snakes.
 Yeah, you had snakes all around you.
 I love that.
 Lots of people all around you.
 I think a good song to have sex needs to have that movement that you feel like you can go with it.
 You can.
 Yeah.
 Right. I'm there.
 You know, and I did this course, I took a course once of a tantric massage.
 And I think it needs to match that vibe of the tantric massage.
 You start like with the physical touch.
 So it needs to be sensitive.
 Not that strong.
 Not that.
 Oh, yeah.
 More like, oh, sensual, slow.
 It was. Yeah, it's good.
 And the course was super weird, actually, but it works when you put it in reality.
 Now it's Los Calientes.
 Rojo.
 Oh my God.
 Now, I actually think this one is maybe a little bit easier than the last one.
 It is.
 Yeah.
 Actually, oh, thank God.
 This show is good for who had like problems with taking shits.
 Right. Yeah.
 We clear you out.
 People that don't poop.
 It's like a treatment.
 They leave here, they go poop right away.
 That's right.
 Right. It's like a medical office over here.
 Is the bathroom here prepared for like for people to take shit?
 Yeah. Titanium reinforced.
 Lots of military technology, you know.
 Very important.
 Yes. There was this one time I went to this fancy hotel.
 I had a meeting and I needed to go.
 I love this about you, by the way.
 In the beginning of the meeting, I was like, oh my God.
 And I left and I went to the bathroom of this fancy, fancy, fancy hotel.
 And everybody was knocking at the door because it was like just one bathroom.
 And then I was like, oh, I'm busy.
 I'm coming.
 And it wouldn't go down.
 Oh, no.
 And I was flushing, flushing, flushing, flushing, flushing.
 When I saw the water was coming like on the floor,
 I was desperate.
 And it took me like 40 minutes there.
 And then they put like stripes on the bathroom.
 It was like, shut it down.
 Yeah, yeah.
 They shut it down.
 And then when I came back to the meeting, they were like, where were you?
 I said, I just took a little walk.
 I'd take a phone call real quick.
 It was bad.
 Probably they put this one in there.
 The spicy shark.
 Eat the heat.
 I don't know if I want to eat the heat.
 Yeah, tough one.
 Yeah.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 No, let it go.
 Let it go.
 I understand in these situations.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 No.
 [SCREAMS]
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]
 [GASPS]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 I know.
 I know.
 For someone who's never had hot sauce before, that is great.
 All right, guys.
 I get it.
 I get it.
 So I noticed that to this day, you'll still
 direct many of your own music videos,
 including for your recent hit, "Involver,"
 which at the time of this interview,
 has something like 600 million views.
 How do you think about pairing a song with the visuals?
 Like, does it start with the choreography
 and then grow from there, or is it more natural than that?
 [COUGHING]
 So, no, it depends on the song and then on the video.
 Sometimes when I'm in the studio,
 I already can vision the video.
 Like the colors are there.
 In the song.
 You can kind of see it.
 Jesus Christ.
 Yeah, I'm like singing, cutting the song.
 I'm in love with movies, series, everything.
 So I like to get inspiration from that.
 So in "Funk Rave," the scene of the chicken,
 with the chickens running--
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 --it's from "City of God," because that's how
 the movie kind of starts there.
 All right, are you ready to move on here to sauce number seven?
 Hell no.
 You are doing great, by the way.
 I am not ready.
 My lips are still burning.
 Ringing, ringing.
 So this one is the jalapeno Chico here in the seven spot.
 Jalapeno.
 Wow!
 It's hitting now.
 I know.
 I knew that was coming.
 It's hitting now.
 I know.
 [SCREAMING]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 How does that work, this whole cat licking of the milk thing?
 Is that working out?
 It's a new--
 It's a new tactic.
 I've never seen it before.
 I'm just trying to put my tongue and sleeve in here.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Until it gets numb.
 So in a 2018 interview with "Paper Magazine," you said,
 "I think when you're a star, you should know that you're there.
 Open to critics and everything.
 Are you the kind of artist who hears and sees everything?
 Like, how committed are you to reading your own press?"
 Oh, I don't give a fuck.
 I used to read every day, Google my name
 and see what was happening.
 Oh, this actually helped.
 It did help.
 It did.
 Not that much, but it helped a little.
 I used to read everything.
 I used to be like, on top of my shit, what are people saying?
 Do they love me?
 Do they hate me?
 Nowadays, I don't give a shit because people are getting crazier
 with the time.
 Online, it's crazy.
 People just create stories, everyday worst stories.
 And you need to be online 24/7, posting 20 million social media.
 And then people say this and say that.
 So I just decided to let it go.
 I don't give a fuck.
 I just do whatever I want to do.
 So I just stopped it.
 This has a-- what's the name of this in English?
 An actual bomb?
 Yeah, atomic bomb.
 This doesn't look healthy, good for your system, for your health.
 Yeah, it can't be.
 For your body.
 It can't be.
 Sodium benzoate.
 What the fuck is that?
 It's a medicine?
 I don't know.
 You know, I shoot first to ask questions later with this sauce.
 You know, like, the less I know, the better.
 And this will be immediate.
 [SCREAMING]
 [COUGHING]
 [SCREAMING]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 [SCREAMING]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 [SCREAMING]
 I'm gonna cry.
 Just let it go.
 Just let it go.
 Have you ever eaten anything like that in your life?
 [GROANING]
 I might join you at that.
 [GROANING]
 Why does anybody do this to themselves?
 [SCREAMING]
 I don't know.
 [COUGHING]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Oh my god.
 You know what?
 Yeah, yeah, tell me.
 Talk to me.
 This is worse than pepper spray.
 I'm going to walk with this.
 Some criminal come--
 Here, have a wing.
 Yeah.
 --somebody.
 Stop them in their tracks.
 If somebody comes steal my shit--
 If somebody comes steal my shit, I will do this.
 Dang it!
 I was ready.
 I was ready.
 If you had to pick just three Brazilian snacks
 to always have on your rider, what would they be?
 I heard that like, Passe Tempo.
 That's the truth.
 I would say Biscoito Globo.
 It's like a global--
 cookies.
 It's not cookies.
 You guys would call chips.
 We call cookies in Rio.
 It's a type of cookie that we sell on the beach.
 [GROANING]
 We eat a lot of corn on the beach,
 so we wouldn't put that in our bags.
 Brazilian candy.
 There is one called--
 [BELCH]
 There is one called--
 [COUGHING]
 There is one called Seven Belo.
 Seven Belo, really good.
 Paçoca.
 Paçoca is like peanut butter, but a square of like peanut
 butter stuff.
 It's really good.
 It sounds delicious right about now.
 How are we feeling?
 Terrible.
 I know.
 I get it.
 I get it.
 But let's go.
 I can keep moving.
 I'm going to walk with this.
 I think that's a great idea.
 To protect myself.
 Who needs a gun?
 Nobody.
 If you have this, you just fucking throw it
 in somebody's face.
 I'm going to have this if somebody comes fight with me.
 That means no one's fighting with you.
 Nobody.
 I'm going to have this.
 Say something.
 Say something, motherfucker.
 I surrender.
 I surrender.
 Going to be the whole night getting fucked up by this shit.
 One bite, it's enough.
 But a mellow ghost.
 Now it sucks, but nothing like the last one.
 The last one hurts so bad.
 I know.
 I know.
 So it almost kind of clears everything out of the way.
 You know what I mean?
 It was so bad that you're almost numb.
 I'm numb.
 I could eat just about anything right now.
 That's right.
 That's right.
 So I've never been more fascinated by a celebrity product line than I am by Pussy by Anita,
 a gynecologically tested, intimate cologne for your private parts.
 I put it today because I knew I was going to sweat so much.
 And I don't have panties on because of this dress they put me.
 So I threw it today.
 Oh, my nose.
 Is it a product that you'd maybe recommend?
 Like let's say for a man who has a day job where he eats scorching hot chicken wings
 every week.
 Yeah, I mean, for me, sometimes the fucking guy's working the whole day.
 He doesn't realize his balls smell.
 That's right.
 He doesn't realize the balls are smelling.
 Your balls, when you work the whole day, you want to fuck when you come back from work home.
 Fuck you.
 Your balls smell bad.
 And you got to use the fucking thing.
 Pussy by Anita.
 I gave to my boyfriend.
 He loved it.
 He was like, oh, yes, smells so good.
 And his dick smelled perfect with it.
 All right, Anita.
 Oh, fuck.
 How come my lips are so-- is it red or like big?
 Better than fillers and Botox?
 Cheers.
 I got some extra.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 I see the face.
 I know.
 I know.
 But the good news is--
 Woo!
 I know.
 I know.
 Woo!
 But you did it.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 You did it.
 It's all behind you.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 It's just a memory.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 Woo!
 Ah.
 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
 And Anita, to close things out--
 Say it.
 Yeah.
 You know, while researching you, I was so taken by your just
 relentless positivity, you know?
 I think that that's really what's kind of taken you
 from the favelas of Brazil to around the world,
 breaking your music in continent after continent.
 There is a word when I started coming here to America,
 and I didn't understand English that well.
 When people met me, they would say that I was this thing,
 and I was always smelling myself to see if I was smelling
 something fruity.
 They said I was refreshing.
 Yes, you are refreshing.
 I asked my teacher, what is refreshing?
 Do they like my perfume?
 Is that fruity or something?
 But then I understood.
 What are the positives that you see in the wings of death?
 Like, is there anything nice that you
 can say about having your mouth incinerated by hot sauce?
 Nothing.
 I just think--
 [LAUGHTER]
 I just think it's good to see people's reaction to torture,
 to this type of torture, because it's not like bad torture.
 It's like some people like it.
 And I think it's good to see--
 I don't know.
 You get to know people better according to their reactions
 to this shit.
 Ah.
 Mm.
 But pleasing about this, nothing.
 It's just the talk.
 Well, you know what I learned about you today, Anita?
 That you are brave, that you are a warrior,
 because you took on the wings of death as someone who's never
 eaten hot sauce in their lives.
 And you are still on your feet.
 I killed it.
 And now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet
 for you.
 This camera, this camera, or this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 Oh, yeah, guys.
 Come on.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I have this new--
 [LAUGHTER]
 --bundle coming out.
 And right now, this month, some days--
 I forgot the fucking dates now.
 I'm so tripping on this.
 What?
 It's my two other songs together with a funk ray,
 which is "Casi Casi," and "I Used to Be a Hope"
 in great songs with great videos.
 I used to be a hoe, but now I ain't no more.
 That's what I say in the song.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Woo!
 Here you go.
 Ice cream coming in.
 Thank you.
 Wow.
 How can you do it?
 You know what?
 The shitty things that I have to do from time to time,
 not as bad as the shitty things that I have to do,
 is just my life, you know?
 So, so true.
 That's the way I think about it.
 OK, so I want this for a friend of mine.
 You can have it.
 I want this for the same friend of mine.
 OK.
 Oh, there's one for another friend,
 and there's one for my protection.
 Personal protection.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Fuck you.
 Your balls smell bad.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans.
