 - No, I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
 (laughing)
 - No, it's all right.
 - That's gnarly.
 I mean, that's like hot, hot.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we close out season 17 with Josh Brolin.
 He's an Academy Award nominated actor
 whose storied credits include No Country for Old Men,
 Sicario, Milk, Deadpool, The Avengers, and many, many more.
 His latest project though is the mind-bending
 mystery thriller Outer Range,
 which is set to release on Prime Video April 15th.
 Josh Brolin, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you, brother.
 - How are you around hot sauce before we dig in?
 - I mean, I've been around hot sauce my whole life.
 I said earlier that my mom's from Texas.
 My dad is a big hot sauce aficionado.
 I'm just kind of a trashy Tabasco guy,
 but you know, I'm willing.
 But I'm interested to volley with you.
 I want to see how this goes.
 And I've been on kind of a diet, you know,
 I got to get ready for Dune and a week ago
 I kind of went into panic mode,
 so I stopped eating all the stuff that I was eating.
 So we're dealing with this on kind of an empty stomach,
 which I think might make for an interesting moment.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 - Right on.
 This is like a Miyagi thing.
 - Yeah, we go.
 Set the tone.
 - Ready.
 Do you always use the same sauces?
 - So every season we're out with the old in with the new.
 So this is the season finale for season 17.
 - So you've had these sauces all season.
 - All season, but this is the last time
 that they'll be on this table.
 - Right on.
 - Sending them off in style.
 - That's really good, man.
 - So your new series Outer Range
 is a mind blowing Western set mystery thriller
 in which you play a hard nosed rancher
 who discovers this large metaphysical black hole
 on his property.
 I've heard you mention a natural draw to the absurd,
 to the weird.
 What is it that sold you on the story of Royal Abbott?
 - I mean exactly that.
 Anything that kind of hybrids something
 that I'm interested in, which would be Westerns,
 but then if I go back to when I was a kid
 and I got exposed to literature or reading
 for the first time, I grew up on a ranch
 and then I remember reading Ray Bradbury's books
 or Isaac Asimov's books, which really contrasted my reality.
 And it was all interesting to me.
 I always loved that kind of fucking with the alchemy.
 So this was a great opportunity to be able to mesh
 something that was instigated in my childhood
 in a really, really positive, amazing way.
 And then what you get is this kind of behavioral chaos
 of humans dealing with something
 that's outside of themselves or what they consider unknown.
 Dawson's Cedar, I'm already getting weird.
 (gentle music)
 I hear my friend Liz laughing already
 and nothing's even happened yet.
 - Dangerous sign. - Because she knows.
 She knows a lot more than I do.
 - So recently you released "The Art and Soul of Dune,"
 a book that pairs your writing along with photos
 from Dune's director of photography, Greg Fraser,
 who by the way, shout out, recently won an Academy Award
 here at the Oscars. - He did, very well deserved,
 yes. - What are the conversations
 like between actors and cinematographers on set?
 Like how does blocking or lens choice
 help inform your approach to a scene?
 - It's really amazing to be able to work with people
 who are very good, skilled, and experienced at what they do.
 It's actually really fun because the switch happens
 almost instantaneously where you can be fucking around
 with somebody and then all of a sudden you're like,
 look, the light's hitting there.
 I know that you perceived a scene in a certain way
 and yet I come in with my own ideas
 and how we can collaborate,
 which can be the most awful experience
 if you're collaborating with people who want it,
 are just interested in putting their kind of power stamp
 on it, but people like Greg, people like Denis,
 actors like Javier, actors like Rebecca Ferguson,
 it's a very kind of loose, very humble place.
 Let's eat another fucking thing.
 I don't know what I'm talking about.
 I don't care about cinematographers right now, man.
 What are we doing?
 - Cocaine, I feel weird.
 - Right, in this weird room together, right?
 - Yeah, I don't know what cocaine feels like,
 but yeah, let's just go with it.
 - All right, so this next one.
 (laughing)
 - Anyway.
 - On that note, this next one is the Calabria.
 - Oh.
 - Pure uncut Calabria.
 - That's beautifully put.
 Thank you for running with that.
 - You know when you eat beets and you go to the bathroom
 and you think something's gone wrong?
 When you look in the toilet and you think
 you might have to call 911?
 - Yeah.
 - What happens to you when you go to the bathroom
 after you eat these?
 - So for me, I think the biology has more or less adjusted
 at this point, you know, to where I can kind of go
 through life without much of a problem.
 For you tomorrow though, the chapter's under,
 like anything can happen.
 - If I film it, will you cut it into the show?
 - Sure, yeah, it can be the bonus scene, you know?
 - Close out season 17 with a bang.
 Is it true that you blew the audition for the fly too
 by over-committing to the metamorphosis problem?
 - How do you know this?
 That's cool.
 That's fishing, I like when that happens.
 Yes.
 - Over-committing to the metamorphosis,
 right then on the ground, foaming from the mouth.
 - It was the fly too and I went in there, man,
 and I totally committed and I did this for like 22 years
 with pretty much every audition I ever did.
 But I was on the ground and I was frothing at the mouth
 because he's in a chrysalis, he's in a cocoon.
 What happens to one that's human that's not used
 to something like morphing from one thing to another,
 one would imagine that it would be a painful process.
 Would one not?
 And then you finish the audition,
 which is always the most uncomfortable part
 where they all look at you and there's a pause and they go,
 thanks for coming in.
 Thank you.
 That was wonderful.
 Thank you.
 And I go, is there anything else you want me to do?
 Or is I can do it, you know,
 that wasn't appropriate,
 there's another way we can deal with it.
 And they go, no, that was fine.
 That was great.
 And then I left and I got back to my place
 and there was already a message from my agent
 and I called the agent back and he said,
 what the fuck did you do in there?
 Literally verbatim.
 And I said, did I get it?
 And he's like, oh no.
 Like, they'll probably never see you again.
 I was like, well, I still don't understand.
 To this day, I was like,
 don't you want somebody who commits?
 Anyway, I didn't do that part.
 I didn't do that part.
 Yeah, this is hotter.
 Oh yeah, I feel that one, man.
 We're climbing.
 So that's number four?
 Number four.
 If I itch my ear, is my ear gonna hurt later?
 Yeah, you know what?
 Actually, that's a good question
 because there is some sort of like, you know,
 cross pollination that goes on.
 But what you really have to look out for is your eyes.
 You know, don't rub your eyes, don't rub your eyes.
 That's a, wow.
 The ingenuity here.
 That's what you get when you're dealing
 with really smart people.
 So in addition to starring in Wall Street,
 Money Never Sleeps, I know that you worked for years
 as a real life day trader, specializing in pullbacks.
 Off the top of your head and without thinking
 about it too much, what do you think
 is the greatest stock market movie of all time?
 Oh, Wall Street.
 I mean, of course, man.
 I mean, that's, what others are there?
 I mean, there are a bunch.
 Wolf of Wall Street, you have--
 Wolf of Wall Street is a great movie.
 I mean, I knew Jordan Belfort for a while
 and I still, I talk to him once every couple of years now.
 But I mean, that's an incredible story, man.
 That's an incredible story.
 But that's not, that's about stocks,
 but it's not about stocks.
 Wall Street is about trading
 and the behavior around trading,
 whereas Wolf of Wall Street is just about absolute,
 you know, unadulterated greed,
 which is kind of amazing in itself.
 I thought that was a phenomenal movie.
 There was one point where I thought I was gonna be
 in a version of that movie,
 but I think Kyle Chandler ended up doing
 what we had talked about
 and I thought he was excellent, excellent, amazing.
 Yeah, I don't feel like anything biologically
 has changed yet.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I'm not sweating, I'm not doing like a Matt Damon
 where I look like I'm gonna fall off my chair.
 (laughing)
 (soft music)
 Los Calientes?
 Mm-hmm.
 Orale.
 Yeah, that's really good, man.
 So far, I feel like we're five for five.
 Five for five, I'm stoked.
 I thought I was gonna have to eat bread before
 just so I didn't chip my,
 I mean, so I didn't throw up.
 (laughing)
 But I feel good right now.
 The whole milk thing is not really becoming an issue,
 even water. Not yet.
 You're crushing it.
 Yeah, this is really fun.
 I mean, I love this.
 This is great.
 I'm getting to eat, it's cool.
 All right, Josh, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor
 and then you just tell us the bigger story.
 Okay.
 Can you pull back the curtain on the movie magic
 that's going on in the makeup chair here?
 Is that from Deadpool 2?
 Yeah.
 So the whole, (laughing)
 so I've had that done a few times
 and when you have that done,
 they put it on you and it slowly, obviously,
 slowly solidifies, right?
 And as it slowly solidifies,
 because it's around everything
 and they've created holes in your nose,
 other than the holes in your nose,
 everything starts to muffle.
 So you lose, the pores start popping
 and you start to lose all sense of sounds
 or obviously sight and all that kind of stuff.
 So the sight thing is one thing.
 And then when you start losing sound,
 it starts to become a little freaky
 and some people can't do this.
 But I have to, I've learned that I have to have a pad.
 And then what I wrote on that pad
 at some point during that process was mild panic.
 And then they get really close to your ear
 and they're like, it's okay, dude.
 You're doing great.
 We only have this long left.
 And then they sit there
 and they basically hold your hand through the process
 because you have no sense of anything.
 There's no sense of space, vicinity, proximity,
 sounds, anything, you lose it all.
 It's a wonderful experiment, but it can be terrifying.
 Why would one wanna do that?
 But you know, when you're doing Deadpool 2,
 you're excited at that point.
 You really don't know what you're getting into.
 So you're like, okay, fuck it, I'll do it.
 - Well, speaking of doing things that make you ask yourself,
 why would anyone do that?
 Are you ready to move on to the back half?
 - Yeah.
 - So this is the Queen Majesty Cocoa Ghost.
 - Cocoa Ghost.
 - Okay.
 You think I curse too much?
 - No.
 - Okay.
 You're such a clean guy.
 - What does that mean?
 - You just feel very clean to me.
 (laughing)
 You just feel like you just showered or you just groomed.
 - Well, maybe that's just like the bald head.
 - Who's your groomer?
 - Me, it's a solo mission.
 - I'm just joking.
 - It's a solo mission?
 - Shout out to Susan.
 - Dude, I love that you just said it, it's a solo mission.
 This is me, man.
 Yeah.
 I've never felt as clean as you look.
 (laughing)
 - What's special to you about the Jiva Theater Center
 in Rochester?
 It seems like that town--
 - Literally the greatest questions I've ever been asked.
 Seriously, like I'm blown away by,
 I don't know who's working for you, but don't fire them.
 Jiva Theater was run by Howard Millman,
 but there was a classic portion
 and then a new plays portion of that year
 that Anthony Zerby ran.
 And Anthony Zerby is an integral part of my life,
 somebody who I met doing a Western show
 called The Young Riders.
 Amazing Shakespearean actor, an amazing friend,
 my officiant, my wedding.
 But it was an incredible four years of my life
 where I would do two plays in rotating wrap
 and sometimes do a classic piece,
 but I was always doing two plays at once.
 So that was kind of what would seem to be confusing,
 but it was actually a really great skill
 to be able to pop in and out of something
 or do one thing in the afternoon
 and then go do a completely different character at night.
 And I worked some amazing actors.
 So it was a great experience.
 And I think if there's any kind of modicum of a perception
 of me being a character actor,
 I think that's kind of where it was revealed
 through Anthony Zerby, you know, yeah.
 You just brought us back something
 that was really cool to me, so I'm sorry.
 Let's fire it up, man.
 Yeah, man, this is interesting.
 I'm starting to feel
 like there's something wrong with me.
 Because I've always felt that way, but now particularly.
 Because you're just running through these hot sauces,
 just crushing these hot sauces.
 It's not that I'm crushing them.
 That's not how I would put it,
 but I would say that there's nothing,
 oh, there you go, there's a little moment.
 There's nothing that has worried me.
 Oh, that's real.
 That's good, actually.
 That's super good and worth the little punch
 that I just got behind my eyes.
 All right, yeah, that's real, man.
 - So I'm fascinated by your stories
 about working with the Coen brothers.
 For example, you know, sending off audio voices
 that you're doing for Hail Caesar and then getting feedback.
 Like, the P's sound really good, but the H's aren't great.
 So maybe work on the H's.
 When you think of all the enigmatic notes
 that they've given you over the years,
 is there one that stands out
 as the most quintessentially Coen brothers?
 - When we were doing "No Country,"
 everything was pretty much drawn
 and you kind of knew what you were doing
 and it was not dialogue-heavy,
 so there wasn't a lot of stuff
 to experiment with and change.
 But I know when I got the satchel and I opened it up,
 I said, "Don't you think he should say something?"
 He looks at the dead guy and then he looks around
 and you can tell he's thinking about,
 "What is this?
 "What do I want to do with this?
 "And shouldn't there be a little something there?"
 And Joel goes, "Well, like, what?"
 And I said, "I don't know, like a huh or like a hmm."
 And they go, "Is there anything else?"
 And I go, "Like, hmm."
 And they go, "What else?"
 And now you're thinking, "They're fucking with me," right?
 So I went through about six of them and they go,
 and Ethan said, "Try the second one."
 So I did the second one, hmm, whatever's in there.
 And then every time we screened the movie,
 once the movie was finished,
 I always knew where Ethan was in the theater
 because every time that moment happened,
 he would burst out laughing.
 So was it a joke or did it help the movie and the scene?
 We'll never know.
 We'll never know.
 Any kind of film that they've come out with
 and they've manifested that's good is an accident.
 - Oh yeah, yeah, just a coincidence that every time,
 every time they make one.
 - Not because of skill or anything.
 - All right.
 - All right, man, it's happening, bro.
 - It is. - It is.
 It's actually. - Finally, finally.
 At long last.
 - Yeah.
 - And just in time.
 - My ears are ringing.
 It's not okay.
 - For the next wing. - Yes.
 - Which is "Da Bomb Beyond Insanity."
 - "Da Bomb Beyond Insanity."
 My teeth are reacting right now.
 - Oh yeah.
 Just crushing that wing.
 - This is a great example of how I've dealt with my life
 and why I am the way I am.
 - Committing.
 - Yeah, but it's stupidity.
 It's a lot of credit cards. - Incredible.
 - Has anybody ever thrown up?
 - No.
 - No?
 - We're in the clear.
 Why, do you think you might be breaking your ground?
 - I don't know, maybe.
 Have you ever?
 - Not on set. - So funny,
 I've seen you do this 'cause I watch your show.
 I'll give it a top five. - Yeah.
 - Oh, wow.
 So why did you drink the milk?
 What's the difference between the milk and,
 oh, god damn, it's hot, dude.
 - So the milk. - That is fucking gnarly.
 - Yeah.
 Crazy hot sauce.
 The milk gives sort of a temporary relief,
 but I don't think anything helps.
 We're just in the soup now.
 - No.
 I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
 (laughing)
 - No, I don't.
 - That's gnarly.
 I mean, that's like a hot, hot.
 - Yeah.
 - Fuckin' shit.
 - It too.
 - Oh, things are starting to run and bleed.
 It's crazy.
 Is that really the, I don't know what to do with myself.
 (laughing)
 - I know.
 - Do you stand up, you sit down?
 - I understand the struggle, yeah.
 - Wow, man.
 - Stretch it out.
 (exhaling)
 Do you still love me?
 - I still love you.
 I love you even more.
 I love you even more.
 - I might ask you to spoon me in a second.
 - Whatever you need.
 Whatever you need to get through it.
 Whatever.
 - It's when you breathe, it's harder.
 - Kind of reactivates, right.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 What did you learn sneaking out
 to go to the punk rock club Godzilla's as a teenager?
 Like, what do you think you learned about yourself?
 - I don't know how you know this, man.
 You're freaking me out.
 (laughing)
 - Careful, careful, careful, careful.
 - No, okay, okay.
 Don't manipulate me.
 (laughing)
 Going down to Godzilla's,
 just as Black Flag and Circle Jerks and Dead Kennedys,
 all those guys were starting to come in.
 It would be like the equivalent of CBGB's back in the day.
 And it was just crazy, man.
 You just see, I mean, it was like, it was performance art.
 And again, like reading Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov
 back in the day when I was a kid,
 that was like the next level and next milestone of that.
 I was like, this is a totally different existence
 and one that I understand a lot better
 than the one that's in front of me.
 Yeah, man.
 - Nailed the dismount.
 - Thank you.
 - Are you ready to move on to the next wing?
 This is the Pucker Butt Pepper Company.
 - Pucker Butt, seriously?
 - Yeah.
 - Or did you just make that up?
 - No.
 - Oh, that's bitchin'.
 (laughing)
 That's cool.
 The Pucker Butt Pepper Company.
 Fuck yeah, it is.
 Okay, here we go.
 Ready?
 - I'm ready.
 (exhaling)
 (dramatic music)
 Man, going in on those wings.
 Dude, if you're gonna do it.
 - I love that.
 - Do it.
 - I love that.
 - Wow, man.
 - We're almost there.
 We are almost there.
 - It's all good.
 (laughing)
 It's all good.
 You know when somebody says it's all good,
 that there's nothing to worry about.
 - Yeah, I know, it's panic time.
 It is panic time.
 - It's all good, man.
 - Can you speak to obsessively baking pies
 on the set of Labor Day?
 Your co-star Kate Winslet,
 she has a quote where she'd say,
 "You'd give pies to everyone.
 "It really was exciting at first,
 "but later on you'd see a pie and go running."
 What's the key to getting that flaky crust?
 - Oh, there was something about how you indent.
 I remember I was taught how to indent the crust
 and how it would cook.
 But I also, there was something about my oven
 wasn't working like other ovens,
 or it was an older house.
 And it actually worked because it was a slower cook
 and it created a harder crust than usual.
 So I made an even better pie by accident
 than I probably would have made had I had the proper oven.
 God, I talk a lot, man, it's crazy.
 - You had that magic oven, you had that magic oven.
 - I did, I did.
 What's your favorite show?
 - Oh, like of all time or like right now?
 - I would say both.
 I said it's two separate moments,
 but what's your favorite show of all time?
 - Where I was in my life and the stretch that it gave to me,
 maybe South Park.
 - Oh wow, yeah.
 And then currently.
 - Without thinking about it too much,
 currently I would say Succession.
 - Oh really?
 - Is kind of the thing that I'm locked into
 or anticipating that someday.
 - My wife got me into Succession, it's very, very good.
 - What about you?
 Favorite all time, that's tough, right?
 To act under these circumstances.
 - Laverne and Shirley.
 - There we go.
 - Let's go for this.
 - Happy days.
 - To Laverne and Shirley.
 - To happy days when Fonzie was in the air
 and you didn't know whether he was gonna make the jump.
 - Let's see if we make it.
 - I actually kind of saturated that.
 - Yeah, well, this is a commitment here.
 Like the fly to audition, but in chicken talk show form.
 Wow.
 (soft music)
 Yeah.
 - No, no, no, sometimes it's like,
 you do this anyway where you just swallowed the wrong way,
 but if you swallow hot sauce the wrong way,
 it just, it's not, but I stopped it.
 - Different ball game altogether.
 You know, there was a time we had Colin Farrell in here
 earlier this season.
 And I had like where I inhaled and like,
 I feel like just, it was just like a straight pepper,
 like just a straight thing, right to the throat.
 Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - And just couldn't talk.
 - I saw that, I don't know if it was the moment with him,
 but I saw you have a moment where you couldn't talk very
 well.
 - Oh, with John Bernthal.
 - Maybe that's who it was.
 - I choked, I legit choked on the wing.
 Yeah.
 - Oh, you actually choked on the chicken.
 - Like a little piece of chicken.
 - Do you ever choke on, you choke your chicken?
 - You know.
 But literally on that episode, I took like a deep breath in
 and I've never had that before when like,
 like vacuum sealed into the windpipe.
 And then I'm doing it in the bizarre context of this show.
 And then I thought I was just going to die on my show.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - But you know what?
 Made it through.
 - You should be very proud of, I mean, the show.
 And like I said, the reaction of so many people,
 when I bring up your show is a massive, like,
 it's not like, oh yeah, I've seen that, I love that show.
 It's like, no fucking way you're going to be on that show.
 It's like a major reaction.
 But was there a moment when you were choking on your chicken
 (laughing)
 that you felt I can't die on Hot Ones?
 - You know what?
 - That's lame.
 I have to say, even though I'm not saying it's not,
 it's not meant to insult your show at all.
 - No, no, but I know what you're saying, right?
 Because it goes one of two ways.
 You know what I mean?
 Where maybe it's almost like,
 oh, well this is me dying on my shield.
 You know what I mean?
 Like if I go down, a chicken wing talk show host
 goes down choking on a wing.
 - Yeah, it's kind of cool.
 - It's kind of cool.
 - It's kind of like legendary.
 - Like they'd write about you later.
 - You know what I mean?
 Yeah, exactly.
 Like I think that's how the legacy kind of lives on.
 - And whether you did it on purpose.
 - Right, and then they can ever,
 they can forever wonder that.
 - Whether you were worried that anything beyond this
 was kind of going to be not as,
 kind of grab public attention like this one is right now.
 - Right, but then I'd never have to face that reality
 because at the peak, I just went down in flames
 and there it is.
 - Like the armpit lick relived here.
 Josh, rolling, taking on every single sauce and a lick.
 That's how I think you put an exclamation point
 on season 17 and look at you taking on the wings of death,
 living to tell the tale,
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - What I have going on in my life,
 what I have going on right now is total chaos
 and insanity inside my mouth.
 I mean, isn't that the point?
 I have Outer Range.
 Where I lick the palette of absurdity.
 Outer Range we have coming out April 15th
 and I'm very proud of it.
 It was a lot of hard work.
 It was in horrible elements.
 When you go through that, you want the result,
 you want to be good.
 And I think we came up with something very interesting
 and original, so I hope you guys enjoy it.
 That was so much fun, dude.
 That was so much fun.
 - You're not just saying that.
 - I don't ever want to do nighttime talk shows again.
 This is like, this is what I've been talking about.
 Like, do we have to break an egg on my head?
 Like, I don't understand what that has to do with the movie.
 - No, you have to eat scorching hot chicken wings.
 - Yeah, that's cool.
 That's cool.
 Thank you, brother.
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans and they said we were crazy.
 They said we were nuts.
 A hot sauce for kids?
 They said it wouldn't.
 It shouldn't be done.
 Well, guess what?
 We did it anyway and now we're doubling down.
 We started with the green, say hello,
 to Hot Ones Jr. the yellow.
 The yellow is a super mild hot sauce
 with sweet tropical heat from mango, pineapple,
 and scotch bonnet pepper.
 Whether you're a parent, child,
 or just want a super mild sauce,
 this is the sauce for you.
 And if you want to be the first person to try it,
 the April Hot Ones subscription box is where you'll find it.
 Sign up by April 15th, heatness.com,
 heatness.com, heatness.com,
 to sign up and order the yellow.
 [laughs]
