 (gunshot)
 (laughing)
 It's like when the air hit my tongue it hurt.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Lizzo.
 She's a three time Grammy award winning singer songwriter
 and I wouldn't be surprised if she adds a few more
 of those trophies to the mantle with her latest project.
 It's called Special, No Features, No Skips
 and it's available now.
 Lizzo, welcome to the show.
 - Come on, talk that shit for me.
 Thank you, happy to be here.
 - Well, you deserve it.
 And before we get started, how are you around spicy food?
 - So I'm pretty good.
 I had an addiction to hot Cheetos
 and I survived the One Chip Challenge.
 So I think this is gonna be a piece of fucking cake.
 So try me.
 It smell good.
 It smells really good.
 It's fragrant.
 Is this notes?
 This floral notes?
 All right, let's get it.
 Shit.
 All right, let's get it.
 - And then you'll start at the other side.
 - I start here or here?
 - There, there, there.
 - Bitch, you almost had me start at the motherfucking end.
 - No, no, I was on it.
 I was on it.
 - I touched it.
 - All right, be careful with that.
 - I touched it.
 Okay, this is the first one.
 - Yep, the classic garlic fresh.
 - Damn.
 You almost had me fucked up.
 - I was watching.
 - That's good.
 - So I wanna start by congratulating you
 on the release of Special, a 12 track opus
 that you've described as your sonic dream.
 And in a recent interview with Vulture,
 your producer, Ricky Reed, tells this story
 about how you laid down the gauntlet in the studio
 telling him, "I want to lead the conversation
 "regarding drums."
 Can you unpackage that?
 (laughing)
 - It was a conversation that we had where like,
 you know, fast music wasn't really a thing right now.
 It's not popular.
 It's like slower drums are more popular,
 like the trappier drums.
 And I was like, what happened to the,
 I'm so excited.
 What happened to those like fast, like fun 80s drums?
 So yeah, we wanted to speed up drums in the 2020s.
 Like every decade, there's a new musical sound
 and I'm like, why not make a statement?
 - You know, and then the opening bars,
 they can be kind of tricky, but they're important
 because they can set the tone for the album.
 Was it immediately obvious to you that Special
 should open with, "Hi, motherfucker,"
 and then you talking about making smoothies?
 - Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?
 No, I actually wanted to start the album
 with like a moodier, like I had this like beautiful song
 I wrote and I'm singing this a ballad on violins,
 no drums, like super dark.
 And then I was going to be like, this is the intro,
 you know, and then, "Hi, motherfucker," happens.
 And then Julie Greenwald from Atlantic Records was like,
 "No, no, this is the beginning of the fucking album."
 And I sat with it for a while and I was like,
 duh, like every Lizzo album starts with like a fanfare
 in your face, like, "I'm crying, 'cause I," you know?
 And so this is like a classic Lizzo album intro
 right in your motherfucking face.
 That wing was good, I ate the whole thing.
 - I saw that, are you ready to move on here to the next one?
 Adobo Loco Island wing sauce.
 - Ooh, it's island? - Yeah, yeah.
 - Where the island is it from?
 - Little tropical vibe over here, Hawaii.
 - This is good. - Mm-hmm.
 - That's real good.
 (gentle music)
 - Mm-hmm.
 I might be like the greatest of all time,
 'cause this is nothing.
 - You know, there's something in the air right now,
 it feels historic.
 - Mm-hmm. - You know, something
 cut and-- - Legendary.
 - Yeah, legendary. - Legendary.
 - Legendary. - Mm, that was good.
 - So you experienced a whirlwind breakthrough in 2019,
 but I know the road to get there was a winding
 and exhausting one, working through music scenes
 in Minneapolis and Houston, and for a while,
 even living in your dented Subaru.
 What would you say is unique or distinguishable
 about Minneapolis's underground hip-hop scene?
 'Cause it had kind of a mythical place for me
 growing up listening to like, Atmosphere,
 and Brother Ali, and Idea and Abilities.
 - Wow, holy shit, yeah.
 Like, there is an incredible rap and local scene there
 that I didn't even know about.
 Like, 'cause you know, I'm from Houston.
 - Yeah. - And I remember
 when I was like wondering, like,
 should I move to Minneapolis?
 I don't know, because there was a producer
 that was like, come live with me, da-da-da-da.
 I went to South by Southwest that year,
 which I went every year.
 And that particular year, every band I went to see,
 or every show I went to, I was like, where y'all from?
 They're like, Minneapolis, Minneapolis.
 I was like, how is every Minneapolis band here,
 like, saturating South by Southwest?
 And I was like, this is a sign to go.
 And I went, and like, there's so many incredible rock
 and music clubs there, so many incredible bands,
 rappers, performers, singers.
 You could sell out every venue there
 with local acts alone in one night.
 I had like the Chalice and Girl Party,
 and I dropped Lizzo Bangers there,
 and they supported me so fucking much in Minneapolis.
 - Pound for pound, what would you say
 is the throwback underground Lizzo rap song
 that had the hardest bars, "Weggula?"
 - So wild.
 How do you know about that?
 Ooh, slob that, I said, no, you was a weggula.
 Tell these people I used to rap.
 Um, I mean, let's, we gotta give it to Bashes and Cookies.
 I was rapping so fast.
 Remember that gooey gooey you took and said, "Ooey, ooey,
 I need two or two of these for my baby, booey, ooey,
 floating like boobies, you kinda nice pair like some boobies.
 Are you high off that doobie doobie
 with your Mr. Reem machine, Scooby?
 Feeling bad with your shit, beep, beep, beep,
 don't make nothing, it keep going.
 - Still got it.
 - I still fucking got it.
 - Are you ready to move on here to this next wing?
 You're doing so good.
 - Yeah, this is like, literally, I'm sleeping right now.
 - Whoa.
 - I'm sleep.
 (gentle music)
 - This one good too, it got a leopard on the front.
 - So you often hear Hollywood actors talk about
 formal acting training, but not so much with musicians.
 How, if at all, do you think that studying classical music
 theory shaped or informed your approach to making hits now?
 - For me, um, I just had to breathe backwards.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - I had to breathe backwards on that one.
 Um, open the window.
 - Yeah, I know that move.
 - A little bit.
 (laughing)
 Being classically trained is incredible,
 'cause I feel like I can speak a language.
 You know, I make pop music, but I like to think
 that I make really musical, interesting pop music
 that, you know, I think a lot about the composition.
 You know, I want my music to sound good,
 even when you mute my vocals.
 You know what I'm talking about?
 And you hear the track and you be like,
 damn, this is like a rich piece of music that,
 you know, fucking John Williams can conduct
 with the fucking Boston Pops.
 - John Williams, yeah, Jurassic Park.
 - JW, Jurassic Park.
 - Jurassic Park, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T.
 - Shout out, legend.
 - Legendary Harry Potter, all of it.
 Understanding the time signature you're in,
 harmony and dissonance and rhythm and cadence.
 I think it is important.
 - And then I read a blog post from a music theory teacher.
 The thesis of it was this,
 rumors flirts with Phrygian mode.
 I hope I'm saying that right.
 Rumors flirts with Phrygian mode using a great deal
 of chromaticism.
 I don't know what that means, but confirm or deny.
 - Confirm.
 The song, it was difficult because it goes
 between major and minor.
 And so it's a half step up and down.
 So, um.
 (humming)
 So those two, that was a major and a minor change
 in one song and it goes back pretty quickly.
 Yeah, it's pretty intricate musical shit right there.
 Shout out to whoever the poo is at.
 - I'm gonna, I'll find the byline, but you cosigned.
 Shout out.
 - Shout the fuck out.
 - Shout the fuck out.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Hittin'?
 - It's good.
 What, DJ Khaled did like two of these?
 - Yeah, we got to three, so we just made it past
 the Khaled mark over here.
 - I understand why he stopped it.
 I do. - You get it.
 - That's good.
 - Yeah, so far hittin'.
 So far we're good.
 - Which one, Los Calientes?
 I like that.
 - There we go, there we go.
 From an artist perspective, how do you decide
 on a lead single?
 - About Damn Time was the last song I wrote for the album.
 I was turning in my masters in March.
 I wrote About Damn Time in February.
 And I was like, this one?
 (humming)
 I was like, I'm gonna drop out this one,
 'cause the hook wasn't done.
 Versus wasn't in a minute, I'm gonna need a,
 it wasn't there yet.
 So I was like, mm, mm-mm.
 And when I finished it, I was like, oh fuck.
 - I see it now.
 - This song need to come out right motherfuckin' now.
 That I've been so down and under pressure,
 I'm way too fine to be this stressed.
 It's like, hello?
 We needed that right then when I dropped that motherfucker.
 I'm so bad at picking singles for myself,
 'cause I think everything I do is incredible.
 I really do.
 - Yeah.
 - I'm just gonna breathe.
 'Cause breathing for some odd reasons
 is getting a little weird.
 - It's getting a little weird.
 It gets dangerous over here.
 - It might be the yiddy.
 The yiddy, you know, is holding me in.
 Hold on, give me a second.
 - Really?
 - That's coming back to you, right?
 You know why.
 It's probably you're having a Pavlovian response
 that's bringing you back to the one chip.
 Yes, because there's a common thread in the pepper
 that Carolina Reaper.
 I didn't think about that 'til just now, but yeah.
 - This isn't bad.
 It's just I got scared for a second, but now I'm good.
 - Oh, crushing it.
 Just crushing these vegan nuggets.
 - I'm looking you in your motherfuckin' eyes.
 - I know, I can see. - Are you eating the chicken?
 - I'm right with you, I'm right with you.
 I'm right with you.
 - Okay.
 - I'm right with you.
 - It's a little lumpy.
 Okay, no, I got it.
 All right.
 - So I'm intrigued by this quote of yours.
 "I don't look to celebrities for style anymore
 "because I've learned the chain of command."
 With that in mind, what we wanna do is show you
 some iconic looks from the past.
 We'll pull them up over here on the monitor.
 - That wasn't bad. - Just curious
 sort of how you reflect on these things looking back, okay?
 - Okay, cool.
 - So the first one.
 - Damn, I'm such a bad bitch.
 (laughing)
 - What went into masterminding the candy bar look
 from the 2020 BRIT Awards, and then shout out to the clutch?
 - I'm American chocolate.
 I look like a snack.
 There's a chocolate drop on my head too.
 And the makeup is chocolate and my nails are chocolate bars.
 - See, those are the details.
 That's what I'm looking for right here.
 - Yeah, the purse say 100%, that bitch.
 We good.
 - Oh, Versace.
 - Two times at the Grammys,
 multiple Versace dresses in that Grammys.
 - I had to do it twice.
 It was my first time going to the motherfucking Grammy.
 So we wanted to be like super old Hollywood, classic.
 Wow, you chose some really beautiful photos.
 I just did an interview the other day
 and they chose some of the first pictures ever taken
 of me of all time.
 (laughing)
 And I was wearing flannels and duck shoes
 out of my motherfucking closet.
 So thank you for this.
 - Yeah, I wanted to be classic and I was, I look beautiful.
 - So this next one is the collared and ghost here
 from Hot and Saucy.
 - I just wanna shout out,
 this looks like a black female owned business.
 - It is.
 - And I wanna say shout out to my sisters.
 Keep running this shit.
 Start your business today 'cause we on Hot Ones.
 And let me tell you girl, I'm loving the blowout.
 It's twist out whatever yo, you know,
 I'm a high porosity girl.
 So I don't know what your porosity is.
 All right, let's get it.
 - Yeah, let's hope you enjoy the sauce after all that.
 - 'Cause if it's nasty, I'm gonna be like, what the fuck?
 (laughing)
 It tastes like collard greens.
 - As advertised.
 - This I can get into.
 We gonna be all right.
 We gonna be all right.
 I'm not mad at this.
 - There we go.
 Do you find that as your star power grows,
 does it become easier or more challenging
 to stay ahead of the zeitgeist?
 - It's growing.
 We're good.
 You thought I was gonna fall.
 - No, no.
 - You thought I was gonna fall off.
 - I never, never.
 - You thought I was gonna DJ Khaled this shit.
 They didn't want me to win.
 When I was young, right?
 I used to have these ideas and I would write songs and stuff
 and I would think of things and then like months
 or like a year later, I would hear that song
 that I had the idea for on the radio
 or I would see things and I'd be like, damn.
 Like I felt very like, I got the same ideas
 that the people who are putting out the ideas got
 and I've always had confidence in that.
 So even now as the static gets bigger
 and I become so synonymous with the cultural zeitgeist,
 I think that my confidence that I've had
 ever since I was little and my vision has stayed true.
 So I really do trust my instinct.
 It's the one thing I can trust in this crazy fucking world.
 Are we doing any more wide shots?
 - Maybe.
 - Can I take my shoes off?
 - Go for it.
 - 'Cause for some, I just, I can't really take.
 - Just go ahead.
 - I can't take it no more.
 - Make yourself at home over here.
 - Oh fuck.
 Who the fuck is Tearface?
 - We're about to find out.
 - How far forward are we in the spice level?
 - So as you can see,
 we're approaching the finish line over here.
 We are in six figure Scoville numbers right here.
 - Can you just tell the bitches at home?
 - Bitches at home.
 Bitches at home, we are climbing.
 We are climbing right now.
 - I thought I wasn't gonna win.
 You thought I was gonna falter?
 Rock a Gibraltar, you know what I'm saying?
 Rock at a halter top.
 - Well, speaking of, speaking of,
 and the chain, the yiddy chain,
 what tools in your life as an entertainer
 do you think have served you best
 as the CEO of a shapewear brand like Yiddy?
 - I'ma finish it.
 You wanna finish yours?
 Don't be a little bitch.
 - I'm going with you.
 I'm going with you.
 - Finish your fucking wings.
 - I'm along for the Lizzo ride over here.
 - No reaction.
 CEO is what I like to call myself.
 Like I'm very hands-on with my career,
 hands-on with everything that I do.
 Like there's a specific kind of bra,
 and I'm wearing it right now,
 that I wanted to make just for me.
 It's a long line bra that pushes up your titties
 and holds the sides.
 And I can have them in different colors
 so I don't just have to wear them underneath my shirt.
 This was a very selfish dream endeavor
 that I selfishly brought to the world.
 - I wanna make clothes for me.
 - It's selfish when you're creating it
 and selfless when you're putting it out.
 - How are you doing so far?
 - I feel great.
 ♪ Feel good to tell ♪
 You know what I'm saying?
 That was cute, right?
 Look at me.
 Look at me.
 Look at me.
 I'm the captain now.
 - Yeah, you are.
 Oh, there we go.
 - I'm the fucking captain now.
 - There we go.
 I know.
 I know.
 I know now I can't go to that.
 'Cause I just dipped a bomb in there.
 - Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
 - There's nowhere to run over here.
 - Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
 - So I know that you've been on the hunt
 for the best plantain sandwich in the entire world.
 Where are we at on that journey?
 Like have you found the one yet?
 Yeah.
 - It's okay.
 - Yeah.
 - Oh my gosh.
 (dramatic music)
 Fucking.
 - Go ahead.
 Jada, place up.
 - I feel like my ancestors was talking to me for a second.
 They said stop.
 You know.
 My titty hurt.
 My titty.
 Hold on.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Take your time.
 - Fuck.
 My titty said stop.
 All right, hold on.
 - Yup, yup.
 - You did this before?
 Fuck, you did that one?
 I'm sorry, I'm gonna answer the question.
 Fuck. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Plantain sandwich.
 It's like when the air hit my tongue it hurt.
 Hold on.
 - Take your time, take your time.
 - Plantain here, you can't wait.
 I had a really good one at Black Freakin' Vegan.
 Really good one in New York.
 You know?
 I feel like it was seasoned.
 It was juicy.
 Had vegan cheese on it.
 No.
 - Yeah.
 - When does it stop?
 - So the worst is over.
 - When does it stop though?
 When does this one stop?
 - 15, 20 minutes from now, this will all just be a memory.
 It'll all be a memory.
 Careful around your eyes and stuff.
 - I'm not gonna touch my eyes.
 Shit.
 Damn, that was fucked up.
 - I know, I know.
 - No, I'm serious.
 What the fuck?
 You know what you did.
 - I do, I do.
 You know what, and this is always a show, I feel like--
 - You took two bites.
 - And that was on you though.
 So I feel like this is-- - You're my brother.
 - This is Spider-Man meme kind of.
 - You're my brother, yeah right?
 - And you're my sister, Lizzo.
 - Aw.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 - Yeah, I know.
 - Right, ding.
 All right, I can eat this one.
 - Whoa.
 I'm gonna just try to keep up over here.
 - Keep up with me.
 - I'm trying, I'm trying.
 All right, what else we got?
 - I think that a great backup dancer...
 A great backup dancer has an awareness.
 Good backup dancers can dance.
 They learn the moves.
 Great backup dancer has an awareness
 of the space around them.
 A great backup dancer can pick some shit up.
 Somebody throw something on stage,
 a great backup dancer can pick it up,
 still hit the steps.
 You know what I'm saying? - Yeah.
 - A great backup dancer can support me energetically
 on stage.
 I think a great backup dancer...
 That's all I got.
 I don't got anything else.
 One bite was fine, right?
 - Yep, yep, here, check this out.
 - What the fuck is that, what the fuck is that?
 - We're coming in, we've got...
 - Oat milk ice cream.
 - Oat milk ice cream. - Is it vegan?
 - Yeah, oat milk.
 - We got vegan ice cream to the rescue.
 - Fuck, that's real good.
 - Yeah, that's right.
 - You held up.
 You are that bitch.
 You are really that bitch.
 Last dab.
 - Last dab.
 - Gordon Ramsay, he cool, he a cool guy.
 - He's the fucking best.
 - All right, my song wants to know.
 All right.
 - All right.
 - What a dream we did it.
 Album out, Yiddy out, watch out for the big girls,
 Emmy nominated.
 - Six times.
 - Six times, I'm with you.
 - Top of the mountain.
 - Still, this was the highest on my list of goals.
 - Yeah.
 - It's like the absence of this.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And it kinda comes back.
 - All right, let's just eat it.
 Let's just eat it, let's talk about this.
 - Yep, yep, yep.
 - Is this hot?
 - Everything is hot.
 We're going in.
 Going in.
 Follow with the ice cream.
 And Lizzo, we've made it.
 We've conquered the wings of death today.
 And if we've learned anything along the way.
 - Wings of life.
 - From Church Choir to Destiny's Child to classic flute,
 your music predilections, your influences,
 they run the gamut.
 So to close things out,
 I wanna do kind of a quick association game with you
 where I toss out a musical act
 and you just give me the first thought or two
 that comes to mind when you think about them, okay?
 James Galloway.
 - The man with the golden flute.
 - Marijuana death squads.
 You like that one?
 - You took me back.
 I'm in death squads.
 I'm in death squads.
 Fun.
 - Lil Flip.
 - Oh my God.
 Freestyle King.
 - Coldplay.
 - Oh, Coldplay, incredible band.
 I did it?
 That's it?
 - We said that there was history.
 There was history in the room today.
 And it is time to put the crown on Queen Lizzo's head,
 taking on the wings of death and living to tell the tale.
 - This is the hottest fucking sauce
 I've ever had in my entire fucking life.
 I just wanna say thank you to all y'all who believe in me.
 Watch out for the big girls.
 We six time Emmy nominated.
 Go stream special.
 And go get some Yeti.
 Yeti.com, bitch.
 (audience applauding)
 We did it.
 I feel like I'm gonna die.
 (audience applauding)
 I feel like the queen right now.
 I couldn't believe how hard it was
 to focus on the questions.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I can tell that.
 - I was like, I wanted to answer so bad.
 Oh shit, this shit hot.
 Oh wow.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
