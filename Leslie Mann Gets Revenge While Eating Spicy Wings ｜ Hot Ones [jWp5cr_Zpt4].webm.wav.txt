 Come here, Chris. Have a little of da bomb.
 Yeah.
 Here, Chris. Let's go.
 I deserve this.
 Yes, you do.

 Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For "First We Feast," I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching "Hot Ones."
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings,
 and today we're joined by Lesley Mann.
 She's an actress whose credits include
 some of the biggest comedy films of the last 25 years,
 from "Knocked Up" to the 40-year-old virgin
 "Funny People," "Blockers," and many more.
 Her latest project, though, is the meta-comedy "The Bubble,"
 which is set to hit Netflix on April 1st.
 Lesley Mann, welcome to the show.
 Thank you.
 How are you around spicy food before we get started here?
 So, I've had Tabasco sauce, like, just a little tiny bit,
 which is very spicy for me,
 and Cholula sauce, which I like on scrambled eggs,
 which I can handle,
 but that's, like, pretty lightweight stuff, right?
 But you never know. Maybe I'll be able to handle it all.
 That's what we see. Secret talent here all along.
 ♪♪
 So, this first one's the classic,
 and we'll start at the handle over here.
 Okay. Okay.
 ♪♪
 Mmm!
 That's what everyone says.
 [ Laughs ]
 Mmm! That's good!
 ♪♪
 It's, like, a little tangy.
 I like it.
 That's a good one.
 Where's the camera? Clas-to-clas sauce.
 Lesley.
 We should get some of this for the house.
 [ Laughs ]
 Very good. Okay.
 So, your latest comedy, "The Bubble,"
 is a rise story about a group of actors
 trying to complete a blockbuster film called "Cliff B6"
 in the middle of a global pandemic.
 In what ways did the challenges of making "Cliff B6"
 mirror the reality of making "The Bubble"?
 Like, were there any jokes or observations
 that you found to be especially on the nose
 in terms of being self-referential?
 Well, at the time, we were all in quarantine
 when Judd was writing the movie,
 and so we were talking to actors
 who were working on movies and TV shows,
 and they were telling us stories
 about things that were going on,
 like being miserable because they had to go
 into a tiny hotel room and quarantine for two weeks.
 So there were disguises and escapes,
 and so we kind of, like, pulled from those stories.
 Are your eyes watering?
 No, not yet. It might just be the --
 I feel like that might have been too spicy for you.
 Whoa!
 Let's go. Let's go number two.
 All right. Dropping the hammer already.
 This next one is the Dawson Cedar Smoke Garlic.
 Okay.
 Hopefully I can handle it.
 Your eyes were watering.
 It has a bite.
 That's good, though.
 So when we had Paul Rudd on the show,
 he talked about how the movies that he finds funniest
 are often categorized as dramas,
 and that some of the most dramatic moments in film
 oftentimes happen in comedies.
 What do you personally think of the phrase "dramatic comedy,"
 which is often used to describe some of your most beloved films?
 I like to be able to feel something deeply
 and also be able to laugh about it.
 I've always thought of myself as, like, a dramatic actress.
 I don't think of myself as a comedy actress.
 And on the topic of Paul Rudd, "Fact or Fiction,"
 he improvised passing gas in that "don't fart in the bed" scene,
 and this is 40.
 Mm.
 I don't know if he likes to talk about that.
 One time I talked about it during an interview,
 and he got mad at me.
 So now he's going to get mad at me again.
 Sorry.
 But I think it's because the person interviewing us was like,
 "He's married to the most beautiful woman."
 But it happened to be, like, this really beautiful woman,
 and I think I embarrassed him.
 Talking about farts and stuff.
 Yeah.
 But yes, he did improvise that.
 Yes, and it was not cool.
 He hot-pocketed me.
 It was not cool.
 Mm.
 I like the garlic and the sun-dried tomato.
 I just sounded like Ina Garten to myself.
 You did.
 Didn't I?
 Mm, I love the cedar-smoked garlic and the hot sauce
 and the chilies and the sun-dried tomato.
 Mm, and then she eats it.
 She's so excited.
 Do you watch that show?
 No.
 Ina is a legend.
 She's a legend.
 This is a food show, and you can't have a food show
 in this space now and not pay respect to the legend.
 So shout-out to Ina.
 Absolute legend.
 Did you see the episode where she talks about
 making brownies for Jeffrey?
 No, tell me about making brownies for Jeffrey.
 So she's like, "When Jeffrey and I met,
 I made him brownies, and that was the key to his heart."
 And then she's like, "It's our, you know, whatever,
 40th anniversary, and I made Jeffrey his favorite chicken
 and some of his favorite brownies."
 And then she like presents the food to Jeffrey,
 and he's all excited, and he says he has a surprise for her.
 And he like pitched a tent, because that's what they did
 when they were first dating.
 And so she goes into the tent, and he follows,
 and she peeps her head out, and she says,
 "If the tents are rockin', don't come and knock it."
 And then sips it down.
 I can't get that out of my head.
 I think about it a lot.
 That is why she's a legend.
 Okay, this is good so far.
 You're crushing it.
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven to go.
 Yep, are you ready to move on to the fourth one?
 Yes.
 Whoa.
 Mm-hmm.
 Got a cut job.
 Mmm.
 Oh, okay.
 It's on my lips.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 That one's--okay, yeah, that kicked it up a little bit.
 There we go.
 What's that one say?
 Oh, it has some cantaloupe melon in this one.
 A little sweetness with the heat, but the heat comes through.
 Mm-hmm, yeah, it does.
 So you have an amazing quote about rude casting directors
 saying in a 2009 backstage interview,
 "When people are being assholes, you might as well not waste your time,
 because chances are they're going to make a piece of shit anyway."
 What immediately comes to mind when you think of the unpleasant
 or dismissive auditioning experiences that inspired that quote?
 I wonder who I was mad at.
 You must have been fresh off of something.
 Right?
 Oh, my gosh.
 But it's true.
 Just, like, treating actors like dog shit.
 Like, we don't have feelings and we're not human beings.
 I wonder what happened that day, though.
 Me, too.
 Something must have happened.
 You know, just like rude people.
 When you're trying to put yourself out there and be open and do your job,
 it's nice to have supportive people around you and not rude people.
 Like with anything.
 I think I'm going to be fine.
 I'm halfway through and I'm like, it's okay.
 You're doing good.
 You're doing good.
 We'll see how things go in the back half.
 I think that's way worse.
 That's the show.
 Okay.
 But before we get there, Leslie, we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Looking back, what's the TV or movie set that made you laugh the most
 when the camera's cut?
 Probably this one.
 The other woman, yeah.
 I had so much fun with Cameron.
 She's one of my best friends.
 Just honestly being with the girls, being with Kate Upton and Cameron Diaz,
 we just had so much fun together.
 We would go out and have wine after work and it was shot during the summer
 and it was warm in New York City.
 It was just like a dream, like a dream job.
 Yeah, is this where it gets crazy?
 Back half.
 You look scared.
 Well, I love how you just dive right in.
 Okay.
 I like that.
 Shoot first, ask questions later.
 I feel like you're struggling more than me.
 Well, there we go.
 This one, Queen Majesty, Coco Ghost.
 Hmm.
 What if I'm just fine with hot sauce?
 Did I speak too soon?
 Should I be the host of this show?
 You might be.
 Maybe we can trade off.
 Like I'll do some people and you can do some people.
 I feel like I could be good at asking questions.
 Yeah, and maybe I could do a movie or two.
 Or you could do a YouTube talk show.
 Yeah, I'm going to ask you about the movie that you did.
 Okay, this one got spicy.
 Hmm.
 Is this Queen Majesty?
 Queen Majesty, Coco Ghost.
 I don't taste anything the cocoa part or just the spice.
 Yeah, the ghost comes through.
 It's the ghost, all ghost.
 Okay.
 What makes the 1971 Hal Ashby directed classic, Harold and Maude,
 a quintessential comedy for you?
 I love that movie.
 Um, well, it seems like, um, maybe, yeah, I feel this one now.
 Oof.
 So we had a VCR player.
 You probably don't know what that is either.
 No, I remember VCR players.
 I'm a child of the '90s over here.
 And we had that movie, Harold and Maude.
 My mom gave it to us for Christmas one year.
 And then we also had the workout video by the guy from the Richard Gere movie, Lou Gossett Jr.
 So for some reason we had his workout video and just Harold and Maude.
 And so my mother and father, that was one of their first dates,
 going to see Harold and Maude at a drive-in theater.
 Oh, almost as romantic as the tent and the brownies.
 Exactly.
 But yeah, so it has, like, history.
 And then also it was all I had.
 But also I really loved watching it.
 And I would cry and be so moved, you know, by--it's such a great story.
 And the music is so beautiful.
 And the acting is so beautiful.
 And I just, like, I really loved it.
 It kind of, like, shaped me in a weird way.
 Thank God she gave me a good movie.
 What if she gave me a different movie?
 And that was the thing that shaped me.
 And then I was, like, just off for the rest of my life.
 Or didn't want to pursue acting at all.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, right.
 What's the big deal with this stuff?
 Why would I ever want to do that?
 Well, shout out to Harold and Maude.
 Yeah.
 Are you ready to move on here to the next wing?
 Yes.
 This is Jekyll and Hyde, 13 Angry Scorpions here in the seventh spot.
 This is a scary-looking bottle.
 Mmm.
 It says freakishly hot.
 This one's not that--this one's pretty spicy.
 Yeah, it grows.
 It grows a little bit.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Did you have any harrowing encounters with wildlife on the set of George of the Jungle?
 Like, what are the mechanics of shooting--
 I did!
 --that lion rescue scene with Bongo and Caesar?
 It's--
 [laughter]
 With Bongo and Caesar.
 Wait, is that the lion scene?
 Yeah, they're famous lions.
 So, yes, they put me in with--I don't know which one it was, Bongo or Caesar.
 So I was in a little tiny space.
 He's probably, like, where you are from me.
 And so this one's really spicy.
 Yeah.
 And it gets so much spicier.
 And so I remember--I think about this a lot because I think, you know,
 when you hear about animals attacking, I think, I don't know why he didn't attack me.
 And I mean, there's really nothing you can do when they're that close.
 If he just jumps at me, I'm dead.
 I just spit.
 That's all right.
 Let him fly.
 Right?
 And they didn't have anyone in between us.
 Just like a man, like, where that sign is.
 Like, what's he gonna be able to do?
 Right.
 And so--and I went along with it.
 So I always tell my daughters, do not listen to anyone telling you, like,
 if you feel, instinctually feel like something isn't safe, trust your instincts.
 Walk away and, like, ask someone smart or, you know, call me or--
 [laughter]
 But don't just listen to the movie people tell you it's safe.
 Don't just go along with it because you don't want to, like, cause a problem.
 Like, I shouldn't have done that.
 Well, you know what?
 Speaking of staring the lion right in the eyes, this next one is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 Oh, no.
 This one's great.
 [dramatic music]
 Oh, my God.
 [dramatic music]
 Yeah.
 Oh, my God.
 [coughing]
 She's gonna look at her right over.
 What?
 I know.
 Oh.
 I know.
 [dramatic music]
 Who eats that?
 I don't see a use for it personally.
 Oh, my God.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm.
 I'm about to fall apart.
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Does it get--oh.
 It grows a little bit.
 It grows a little bit, but we'll kind of gas pedal to the finish line here.
 [dramatic music]
 Oh, my God.
 What?
 Mm-hmm.
 How long does it last?
 Oh, that's really bad.
 It'll just suck.
 What should I do on this show?
 You might be in the room.
 Oh, my God.
 Not your idea, though.
 No, but you know what?
 I ended up as ho--you know, like this guy, he's just got the idea.
 How much hot sauce does he have to eat?
 Nothing.
 You know what I mean?
 Come here.
 Yeah, Chris, show yourself.
 Come here.
 Get out here.
 Come here, Chris.
 Have a little of da bomb.
 Yeah.
 Here, Chris.
 Let's go.
 I deserve this.
 Yes, you do.
 This is for you, Leslie.
 Okay.
 And for you, John.
 Yeah, about damn time.
 And for the fans.
 Oh!
 Wait, stay there.
 Stay there.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 Just one second.
 Let's just watch you for--wait, you can put the rice back.
 For one second.
 We have to watch--watch--
 Watch, yeah, watch Chris melt, but he won't.
 He is stoic.
 He is stoic.
 There's one thing I know about the guy.
 [laughter]
 He's dying.
 Fine.
 [laughter]
 Is it awful?
 It's bad.
 This is what you do to people.
 I know.
 I know.
 [laughter]
 Look at him.
 He's crying.
 [laughter]
 You okay?
 Yeah.
 Here we go.
 Do you have any questions?
 Am I dismissed?
 Yes.
 I feel like a deer is going in.
 Okay, you can go.
 Here, for later.
 Thank you.
 [laughter]
 Let's hear it for Chris, everybody.
 [applause]
 That made me feel so much better.
 Yeah, me too, actually.
 Didn't it?
 You know, like that was long overdue.
 Yeah.
 You know, I'm happy that you did that, you know?
 Me too.
 [laughter]
 [clears throat]
 Ooh, it just caught in my throat.
 I know, yeah.
 Like it has, it just, like it lives in there.
 Yeah, it does that.
 It's like living in the back of my throat.
 Yeah.
 And when I swallowed it, it came back up again.
 You relive it again, yeah.
 Yeah.
 [music]
 How you doing back there?
 Yeah, Chris, how you doing?
 Are you dying?
 [laughter]
 Okay.
 That's good.
 Okay, okay.
 [music]
 I'm not going to die.
 [laughter]
 I'm not going to die.
 [laughter]
 I'm not going to die.
 I'm not going to die.
 I'm not going to die.
 [music]
 Mmm.
 Heat index, smoking hot.
 I'd have to agree, but I think after the last one.
 Da Bomb.
 Da Bomb.
 Almost a walk in the park, right.
 [music]
 Whew.
 This is pretty spicy too.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 But we're almost there.
 There's a little Da Bomb left in there.
 Yeah, like kind of reactivates.
 Combining with...
 [laughter]
 It's reactivating Da Bomb.
 Mmm.
 What's the Leslie Mann movie line that gets yelled at you most in the wild?
 So many classics.
 I'm very curious what's at the top of the list.
 Let's get some fucking French toast.
 I think it's that one.
 After that movie came out, a lot of girls come up to me and say, "Oh my gosh, that's
 so me."
 And I'm like, "What?
 Driving and being crazy or whatever."
 That's so me.
 I do that all the time.
 I'm like, "Oh no.
 That's a bad idea.
 Don't do that."
 Oh god.
 It just got...
 Little Da Bomb.
 It's like in my throat.
 [music]
 On the side first.
 There you go.
 Okay.
 Oop.
 Oop.
 Okay.
 Cheers, Leslie.
 What a ride.
 Okay, cheers.
 [music]
 (bright music)
 On the side first.
 - There you go.
 - Okay.
 - Woop!
 - Okay.
 - Cheers Leslie, what a ride.
 - Okay, cheers.
 (bright music)
 That's a spicy one.
 - That's a spicy one.
 But the good news is Leslie man,
 that we're at the end of the road.
 Conquered the hot ones gauntlet
 and just one more question before we roll credits.
 We're gonna take it to your sweet spot,
 which is playfully ribbing your husband
 and longtime collaborator Judd Apatow.
 To close things out,
 how do you think he would fare against the wings of death?
 Can you paint the picture for us
 in as much detail as possible?
 - That one's like really burny.
 (laughing)
 - That one's really, really,
 that one I don't like.
 These two are the worst.
 - Let the record show.
 - So we went to a spice restaurant
 and when we were traveling,
 that one's really bad.
 I don't like that one.
 And he had this whatever, spicy food
 and then was having a margarita with it
 and he went out to the car and passed out.
 He can't handle spice.
 He would die.
 He would not be able to handle this.
 - But you know who can handle it?
 Leslie man, taking on the wings of death,
 living to tell the tale and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - What do I have going on?
 Well you, this.
 I have The Bubble coming out April 1st, which is exciting.
 It's a really fun movie.
 It's on Netflix and that's kinda it.
 Thank you.
 - Good job.
 - Oh my God, so fun.
 I was really nervous about it.
 Maude and I watched, God it's still burning,
 Gordon Ramsay episode.
 She's like, "Mom, you have to do it.
 "You have to do it."
 So that's why I'm here but then I was really scared
 and it's really burning still.
 How long does it take?
 - It's a diminishing return situation so you'll be back.
 - Okay.
 That was so fun though.
 - You had a good time?
 - Yes, so fun, thank you.
 - So good, it was really nice to meet you.
 Tell Maude I said hi.
 - I will.
 - Can you fight Chris?
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
