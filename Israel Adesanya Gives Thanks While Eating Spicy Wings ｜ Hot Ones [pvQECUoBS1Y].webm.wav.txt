 (sniffing)
 - Oh man.
 (laughing)
 Is it clay or sinuses?
 (sniffing)
 Oh, I can smell everything.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on and happy Thanksgiving everybody.
 For First Sweet Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Israel Adesanya.
 He's one of the UFC's most accomplished
 and dominant fighters, having previously defended
 his middleweight championship belt five times.
 Sure, he may walk in today's interview
 with a professional record of 23 and two,
 but how will he fare going the 10 round distance
 with the wings of death?
 I guess only time will tell.
 Israel Adesanya, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you for having me.
 - So you did an episode of Truth or Dab
 about a year ago with Anthony Joshua
 and basically bodied our spiciest wings.
 How confident are you going into today's challenge?
 - That was then and this is now.
 I just had a fight like two days ago,
 so yesterday I found out through having
 a spicy chicken sandwich that I might have some cuts
 under my tongue or around my tongue.
 So yeah, we'll find out.
 - Are you ready to get started?
 - I'm ready bro.
 - Let's go.
 (dramatic music)
 Let's go.
 - Cheers.
 - You always have to wait for like the surprise kicker.
 - That's someone who's been around.
 - Part one, part two or part three,
 but this is like.
 - There we go.
 - I'm actually hungry.
 (laughing)
 This is good wings.
 - So my voice still hasn't fully recovered
 from Saturday night's event at Madison Square Garden.
 Yeah, went to the fight, took the team.
 Yeah.
 And I know it wasn't the result that you were looking for,
 but it was still just an epic fight, epic performance.
 And with today being Thanksgiving,
 the line that you had in your post fight press conference
 about being grateful really stood out to me.
 What is it that you're grateful for
 and why do you embrace moments like these,
 no matter the outcome?
 - Okay.
 It's still a good, but I just got like the part two.
 (laughing)
 What am I grateful for?
 Yeah.
 Just the moment, like just seeing,
 looking around and seeing a lot of Kiwis,
 all the people from back home.
 I didn't even get to go to Times Square
 'cause I can't really go to Times Square like I used to.
 And my face is plastered on the fucking screens
 and Madison Square Garden.
 I diss on you as in headlights.
 And yeah, so I'm just grateful for these moments
 and grateful for the opportunity.
 Grateful for the life I live.
 'Cause I mean, it wasn't long ago,
 but I still remember like, you know,
 oh, can I get five bucks on number seven
 at the gas pump, that kind of stuff.
 So now, yeah, being in this situation,
 you just have to be grateful for everything.
 The good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful, everything.
 (gentle music)
 If I start speaking in tongues, forgive me.
 What's the one that, one of my favorites is Khaled.
 Oh yeah.
 If I quit, don't mean I gave up.
 I like that.
 That's mentality.
 You see through that, you understand that.
 You're playing 3D chess like Khaled.
 Facts, 4D.
 4D.
 It's not even here, we up there.
 So far, so good?
 Looks like you're enjoying the wings.
 I'm hungry, man.
 I can see that.
 Well, I'm trying to like, okay, let me save my show.
 And I don't want Nigerian, like this is even like,
 appalling, this is the first wing,
 and this is appalling in my culture.
 Right, you gotta represent.
 This should, sorry.
 The wing, it's like a cottage, all that.
 What would you say was your greatest press conference bar?
 Like you seem to approach these things
 almost as a rapper would a cipher.
 My favorite was the ignoramus buffoonus,
 if you recall that one.
 Oh yeah, well.
 (laughing)
 And then Costa.
 Wasn't that like, what's my favorite one?
 Let me see.
 I think Nosebleeds to Nosebleeds is classic.
 Yeah.
 I love that.
 And actually, funny enough,
 today might be the anniversary actually.
 So today, eight years ago, I believe,
 I was in Melbourne, back then at Etihad Stadium,
 while I watched the Ronda Rousey versus Holly Holm
 from the Nosebleeds.
 And I saw Robert Whittaker fight there
 against Uriah Hall.
 And then how many years later,
 I fought in the same arena, now Marvel Stadium.
 And I told him back then I was in the Nosebleeds,
 and I'm gonna make his nose bleed.
 And I did what?
 I made his nose bleed.
 Bars, are you ready to move on here?
 Oh, I got bread.
 To round number three.
 I like how you get me comfortable.
 There we go.
 You just chilling like, "Ah, we're having a good time."
 It's just the barbecue, little fake leaves, all that.
 We at the cookout.
 We're at the cookout.
 Let's go.
 I like how he looks at you before he takes a bite.
 It's like he's trying to like-
 I'm sizing you up.
 Yeah, exactly.
 I can feel the energy.
 It's just like, "Hmm."
 Let's see, how you going?
 This is my face down, you know?
 This is my stare down.
 It's element.
 Welcome to my arena.
 Welcome to my arena.
 This is like every week.
 Every week.
 You're a psychopath.
 For like eight years, I know.
 You know Dan Hooker, right?
 Yeah.
 He's a, you gotta get him on here.
 So he fought this really good fighter,
 the phenom, what's his name?
 The Peruvian Prince.
 I can't remember his name.
 Forgive me.
 On Saturday.
 Yeah, on Saturday.
 And the kid is known for like leg locks.
 Yeah, he kept trying to get down there.
 Yeah.
 He kept trying to bring him down there.
 When he finally got it,
 if I recall, he got an ankle lock
 and then he got like a knee bar
 and he just like cranked.
 And I remember the guy's face like scraping.
 You see Dan just sitting there like,
 with his leg out, like literally,
 his leg being hyper-extended
 and Dan just sitting there,
 hit him in the body a few times.
 And the guy's there like cranking for his life
 for maybe about 10 seconds.
 And the guy goes,
 like, does this guy know?
 And Dan's sitting there just like,
 cool.
 He's a psychopath.
 That's how he'd be on this show,
 just whatever sauce.
 He's white as well,
 so you know he's gonna go red.
 (laughing)
 But he's a psychopath.
 He'll endure.
 His fortitude.
 I don't know, does Dan like spicy food?
 He lived in Thailand.
 Yeah, I'm sure.
 He's got some foundation there.
 He'll be fine.
 Yeah, he lived in Thailand for a while.
 (soft music)
 I'm waiting for that bit where that music comes on.
 Okay, I can smell this one.
 You know that bit when it's like boom, uh-oh.
 Yeah.
 (air whooshing)
 (laughing)
 That like airy music.
 Yeah.
 Call that a little metal on metal.
 That's what we call that.
 We call that one the scrape.
 Yeah, the scrape, yeah.
 That's what I'm waiting for.
 (laughing)
 So far, so good.
 So far, so good.
 I can smell this one though.
 I can smell the fire.
 (sniffing)
 Yeah, I can smell the spice on this one.
 How are the cuts holding up?
 A problem or not a problem?
 There we go.
 I'm glad I came here hungry.
 So maybe that makes me wanna attack these more.
 There, I can see it.
 Yeah.
 So I'm actually fascinated by New Zealand's
 King in the Ring event,
 a single elimination kickboxing tournament
 that sounds like something straight out
 of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie.
 Yes, sir.
 Can you pull back the curtain
 on what that event is like from a fighter's perspective,
 having to go back to back to back
 in a matter of hours for a title?
 Very good question.
 So, hold up.
 When you do King in the Ring, right,
 you have to fight if you win three times in one night
 or if you come second.
 When you have one fight, even if it's kickboxing,
 three minute rounds, three rounds,
 after the fight, guess what happens?
 You get an adrenaline dump, okay?
 So I'm glad I had people in my corner like Doug Viney,
 who's one of our coaches.
 Shout out to Doug.
 (kissing)
 But one thing he said early on that night is like,
 "You only have one fight,
 'cause if you don't get that fight done,
 those other fights don't exist."
 And that has always stuck with me.
 And I have to flex as well.
 So King in the Ring, I did it at two different weight classes.
 I did it at my weight, cruiser weight,
 and then heavyweight.
 And I won it three times.
 So I did that cruiser weight twice
 and I went up to heavyweight once and I won it as well.
 So, just a little, just so you know.
 Know your history.
 Know your history.
 The more you know.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 These are good so far.
 I'm surprised.
 I'm still waiting for the (mimics air whooshing)
 Okay, it's crunchy.
 - Mm-hmm.
 (crunching)
 - Mm, she just squirted.
 (laughing)
 She squirted.
 - You saw that?
 - Mm-hmm.
 Mm, this is Asian fusion.
 - Yep.
 - I can taste it.
 I live in China for a bit.
 - I am not.
 - So I can smell.
 - Bringing you back.
 - Who does your research?
 Do you do your research or does that?
 - Okay, let's see.
 (sniffing)
 Just said, did you get hired
 or did you set this whole thing up?
 - So, where's Chris?
 - Chris is the, who created the show?
 - Chris right there.
 - Hi Chris.
 Good job.
 - But anyways, he was looking for somebody to host it,
 ask me about it and like just the way he was like,
 "Well, what if we interview celebrities
 "but have them eat increasingly spicy chicken wings
 "over the course of the interview as a way to break it down?"
 - Genius.
 - And that was like a Cupid's arrow into my brain.
 - Yeah.
 - Fell in love with it and here we are eight years later
 as he's season 19 doing this.
 - Fuck yeah.
 - That's what I'm saying.
 (laughing)
 - I'm just glad to be finally here
 'cause when we did it on COVID times,
 I was like, "Uh-uh, I need to do this."
 - We gotta do it for real.
 Gotta do it for real.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 - Well, here we are.
 - The whole thing, interviewing someone
 and making them feel uncomfortable,
 that you get the best content out of that.
 This, I think it's all kind of based off this
 'cause you have even Cold as Balls, Kevin Hart.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - That's cool as well.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah, this I think accepted all that.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Well, thank you for saying that.
 I appreciate that.
 And then let me pass a compliment to you
 'cause you can kind of do whatever you want.
 You have an actually good YouTube channel.
 You have an actually good YouTube channel.
 - Thank you.
 Shout out to my brother, David,
 Freestyle Bender on YouTube.
 Check it out.
 - Get that plug, get that plug.
 All right, Izzy, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram.
 Pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 What is the significance of the one that got to you?
 And is there one in your storied career of walk-offs that-
 - This is the best one by far, classic.
 Okay, so I'll explain the story.
 This show was UFC 243 in Melbourne, Australia.
 It's my second time about to fight in Melbourne
 'cause the first time was Anderson.
 (burps)
 Excuse me.
 - But it flat.
 - Yeah.
 And then the first time when I was fighting Anderson,
 I remember I told Dana, like,
 "I want to do something for the walk-in."
 And Dana was like, "No, no, no, no.
 He's not really about that kind of shit."
 And I was like, "Whatever."
 'Cause Robert was meant to headline that show.
 I ended up headlining it 'cause he called in sick.
 And then when it was this time, it was me versus Robert.
 I was like, "Nah, this is my show.
 This is my time."
 57,127 people, biggest attendance to date.
 So I came out to this track, Hype to Hype.
 Came out with my boys, who was getting buck.
 And it was just, it just set the tone
 'cause I walked into that stage, that arena,
 into the octagon like a king.
 I felt like a god.
 I just, and what did I do?
 I went in there, showed off, and I showed out.
 And closed the show in a beautiful way.
 And I defended my title for the first time.
 Ah, Nana Helen.
 - Yeah, what role did Nana Helen play
 in the trajectory of your fight career?
 - Fuck, I literally just got chills.
 When my family moved to New Zealand, right?
 I've always said this, and I've said this at nauseam,
 but it's part of my story.
 I didn't really realize being black was a problem
 'til I moved into a Western country, the Western world.
 And people made me feel different for my skin color.
 'Cause I see white people in Nigeria all the time.
 I never, I was always just fascinated.
 Like, oh, that's cool, oh, look at your hair.
 You know, like, just, you're amazed.
 So some people were like that at school with me.
 They're like, wow, you know, you've got cool hair, you know?
 But most people were not.
 They were just either, I think it's taught, racism's taught.
 So it was weird.
 But Nana was one of the first people
 to invite my family into her home.
 So this is the first time me seeing her
 in I think over 18 years.
 She's still with it, bro.
 She still lives by herself.
 She gets checked on and stuff,
 but she's always just, she'll wink at you
 and give you real quick quips.
 And she watches the fights.
 So Nana, I'm okay.
 I should actually call her.
 But yeah, she's all there with her team of old ladies
 and they sit there and they watch the UFC when I fight.
 Yeah.
 - Love that. - Yeah.
 - All right, are you ready to move on here
 to the back half?
 You're doing great.
 - I'm waiting for the fucking shit.
 - I think it might happen here, but maybe not.
 - Let's see.
 (dramatic music)
 - Turmeric bomb, I see it there.
 So this is like, it's not really,
 oh my God, I'm gonna die,
 but I can start to feel like the,
 it's getting moist a little bit.
 - Yeah, this is like some physiological effects.
 - Yeah, it's responding.
 My body's responding.
 (laughs)
 Yes.
 - So your affection for anime has been a theme
 throughout your career,
 from Death Note references in the Octagon,
 to even your Avatar inspired style bender nickname.
 - Yeah.
 - How would you say being a weeaboo has most served you
 as a mixed martial artist?
 - In so many different ways,
 it's just helped me tell my own story,
 be the protagonist in my own story,
 be player one in my game.
 Like right now, okay,
 I've already seen the setup for my next storyline,
 the Hunter Becomes the Hunted.
 And certain characters in animes as well,
 I draw inspiration from.
 Like when Gai Sensei, who's Ruckley's master,
 when he opened the Eight Gate,
 they had a whole, like,
 I think maybe two episodes telling his backstory.
 And when he finally opened Eight Gate,
 and he's standing there,
 and he's just red,
 and got the flame and Madara's in front of him
 at the Great Ninja War.
 I cried actually when that moment happened,
 but it was, yeah, it was just inspiring.
 And people say, "Oh, Route 33,
 oh fucking hell, you still trying to rap, shut up."
 (laughs)
 Yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 But I'm still waiting for the pin to drop.
 Ready?
 (laughs)
 That's it.
 - Yeah.
 What's the best-
 - How are you feeling though?
 - So this is where it kind of changes for me.
 So like right now my tongue is a little bit on fire.
 My lips are numb.
 - Lips are numb, but my tongue just caught away for that.
 - Yeah.
 So I think what happens is it's like,
 I know what to expect.
 Same with you probably.
 - You know, because you've already been there, you know?
 So that's what I think ends up happening is like,
 I know what to expect, so I'm never panicking.
 - Yeah.
 - But I'm also no superhero, so I'm feeling this shit.
 - You're human.
 - I'm a human.
 - I respect that.
 - I'm a human.
 - But you're still fucking psycho.
 (laughs)
 - What's the best piece of financial advice
 you've ever gotten from your father?
 You know, it's not every day that a big money athlete
 has the benefit of being raised by an accountant.
 - Yeah.
 I'm stubborn.
 So when I was young, he was trying to get me to,
 I gotta get the milk.
 - Yeah.
 I'm going in too.
 I was waiting for you, you know?
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 - Thanks for having me, man.
 - Of course, Izzy, thank you.
 - Yes.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 (laughs)
 That's sweet milk.
 That's actually
 delicious.
 When I came back from China,
 tried to get me to get a house,
 I'm like, "Oh, I don't want the responsibility
 "of owning a house," and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 I'm too young.
 Stupid.
 Lost a lot of money.
 I mentioned when I got into the UFC,
 I was like, "Every time I don't listen to this man
 "about money, I end up going broke.
 "I should probably listen to this man."
 I listened to my gut as well,
 and he checked every box off of me, put it that way.
 But yeah, I listen to him when it comes to money
 because he knows how money works.
 Fuck me, that bomb.
 Ready?
 - Ready.
 (dramatic music)
 - Mm.
 I think this is where it starts to, ah.
 - Yeah.
 This is a different level.
 - (speaking in foreign language)
 Mm.
 (speaking in foreign language)
 (growling)
 My precious.
 (laughs)
 (growling)
 (sighs)
 - You gotta feel it, don't fight it.
 - No.
 - Just roll with it.
 Oh yeah. - Yeah.
 So people that are watching this on Thanksgiving
 are probably just hours away from sitting down
 with a turkey, macaroni and cheese, stuffing, green beans.
 When you think about a proper Nigerian feast,
 what are some of the non-negotiable dishes
 that have to be on your table at the Adesanya function?
 - Jollof rice, standard.
 So Nigerian foods.
 (burps)
 Excuse me.
 Goggle a little bit.
 - That's smart.
 (gurgling)
 - There's levels to this. - Mm-hmm.
 - Ah, that's better.
 So you have the swallows, which are like the,
 it's like a doughy type element.
 So you might have eba, which is made from corn maize.
 You have amala, pound of yam, fufu, semal, different types.
 And if you use those, you break it off
 and put it in a different type of stew.
 You can have a foirero, oguano, fried stew,
 goat meat stew, anything.
 And then you, I feel like this is the thing.
 Eating with your hands is different
 'cause we've lost our relationship with food.
 - Yeah.
 - I'm so, I'll eat this at a restaurant.
 They'll give me fork and knife.
 I'm like, "The fuck for?"
 (laughing)
 What you want me to do with this?
 - It's not.
 - This is your hands.
 I'm the guy at Nobu.
 I'll be eating and I'd like.
 (laughing)
 I don't give a fuck.
 - Tantalizing.
 (screaming)
 - Correct guy.
 You're a correct guy.
 Who taught you tantalizing?
 - You did.
 - When?
 Ah, that's right.
 (laughing)
 Good recall.
 I like that.
 I like that.
 Mm.
 Tantalizing.
 (laughing)
 You get sense, my guy.
 You get sense.
 See now my nose is dribbling.
 (laughing)
 Oh man.
 Are they clay or sinuses?
 (sniffing)
 Ah, I can smell everything.
 (dramatic music)
 (groaning)
 - Tranquil, peaceful.
 - Pain is a state of mind.
 It only affects you if you let it.
 - So as someone who grew up inspired
 by Shaolin monks and Bruce Lee,
 is there a film that you think best encapsulates
 the experience of being a fighter?
 - Mm, ooh.
 So "Ung Bak" was the movie I watched, right?
 That's a movie that I feel like made Muay Thai
 mainstream to the world.
 (burping)
 Excuse me.
 Let's do like a whole segment with all my burps just like.
 (laughing)
 - Rapid fire.
 - Yeah.
 - He's already given us our social clips.
 - You're welcome.
 - One of my favorites, the drunken master Jackie Chan.
 That was a good one to go.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Classic, funny.
 His movies would just like excite me
 'cause he just seemed like he didn't wanna fight
 but he's having fun doing it.
 - Yeah, his movies are like funny.
 Like his fight scenes are like funny.
 - Exactly.
 Like it invokes just the right emotion out of me.
 It's like, I don't wanna hurt anybody.
 (swooshing)
 No, leave me alone.
 (swooshing)
 (laughing)
 (swooshing)
 No, I'm so sorry.
 (swooshing)
 (swooshing)
 (laughing)
 It's crazy.
 And he did all his own stunts.
 Most of them.
 He was Tom Cruise before Tom Cruise.
 - So, what we have to do to close things out.
 A spicy turkey leg for Thanksgiving.
 (dramatic music)
 - Freshly opened.
 No fugazi.
 - No fugazi.
 (dramatic music)
 (laughing)
 Yup.
 Ooh.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - No fugazi.
 - No fugazi.
 (dramatic music)
 - Whoa.
 - I'm gonna rub it in first.
 - Yeah, okay.
 I'll join you at the party over here.
 (coughing)
 - And I'll use, let me see, I'll use this drumstick.
 - How smart.
 I was like gonna be like, how are we gonna do this?
 - Man, this is my first rodeo.
 Telling you, I'm from Lagos.
 We're very innovative over there.
 Just don't open your emails
 if you get it from a Nigerian place.
 I'm joking.
 Ready?
 Cheers.
 - Oh, bam.
 - Ah, it's hot, okay.
 The temperature.
 - Yeah, both.
 - Hot.
 (laughing)
 It's actually a really nice turkey leg.
 - Yeah, it's actually like a delicious turkey leg here.
 Celebrating Thanksgiving.
 - Is the bone.
 - The hot one's way.
 As only we can.
 And here we are at the end of our spice road,
 closing out another Thanksgiving special.
 As your fans know, you're an incredible
 and undeniable talent.
 You're pretty crazy yourself, Izzy, by the way.
 - I am.
 (laughing)
 - But I was interested to learn
 that if it wasn't for fighting,
 maybe you would've been a graphic designer.
 And after your post-fight career,
 I've heard you dream about opening up an animation studio.
 So I know that this puts you on the spot a little bit,
 but we would be so honored.
 - I'll do it.
 - If you could give us a commemorative
 Israel Adesanya sketch.
 Commemorate your experience here.
 - On hot ones.
 - On hot ones.
 - Okay.
 Give me two seconds, I'll put this away to the side.
 I'll put it right here.
 You'll be like five minutes.
 - Sure, take your time.
 - I'll just do this.
 (humming)
 It's my own theme music.
 - Play your one in your own game.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 I wanted to use it as a stain on the thing.
 - I like, yeah.
 I like that there's that stain though, you know?
 - Yeah, I'm gonna use it as a template.
 Something nice.
 Oh yes, there it is.
 Came to me.
 Sometimes you just have to let the universe
 tell you what to do.
 I'll leave it at that.
 Just quick little sketch.
 I can't wait to, oh.
 Not sure what I was expecting, but this is amazing.
 It's like we have the Pico cat, but I must.
 To a full blown Thanksgiving turkey.
 And look at you, Israel Adesanya,
 taking on the Hot Ones gauntlet, bodying it,
 like a Thanksgiving feast,
 and then giving us a masterpiece to forever hang
 in the Museum of Curiosities.
 And now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Now for the first time in a long time,
 I'm gonna enjoy Christmas with my family properly.
 All of us together, and New Year's,
 actually celebrate with a whole countdown and everything.
 And pretty much just enjoy life.
 There's more to life than fighting.
 I love this game.
 I'm still a savage in this beast.
 I'm coming back for everything.
 Like I said, the hunter becomes a hunted,
 but you have to enjoy life
 'cause there's more to life than fighting.
 And there's more to life than whatever you're doing.
 So yeah, right now it's time to smell the roses
 and then eventually the warrior will get back in the garden.
 (clapping)
 Thank you.
 - So good.
 Let it go.
 - I would.
 - You did so good.
 - Thank you.
 - This is going to be.
 You had a good time?
 - Yeah, okay.
 Man, you made it so easy.
 You're a savage.
 And my tongue's not burning anymore.
 - We care, we fixed you.
 We fixed it.
 - Easy.
 I'll take a picture of this.
 (burps)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
