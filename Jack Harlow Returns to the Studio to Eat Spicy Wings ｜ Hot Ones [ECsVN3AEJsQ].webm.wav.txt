 (sighs)
 My God, you blowin' my mind today.
 - Yeah, and your eye and everything.
 - Huh, come on, what you got?
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's goin' on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Jack Harlow.
 He's a Grammy-nominated rapper and founder
 of the music collective Private Garden.
 Check out his debut studio album,
 "That's What They All Say,"
 which is certified golden, available now.
 Jack Harlow, welcome to the show.
 - Thanks for having me.
 This is a dream come true, like I was telling you.
 I've been manifesting this for a little bit.
 My best friend's in the green room,
 and y'all have allowed him to eat and lockstep with me,
 so he has a set of wings too.
 But he put me on the show like four years ago.
 He's like, "Yo, one day we gotta do this,
 "and now to be here doing it, thank you."
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 (alarm buzzing)
 - All right, well, you ready to get started with this one?
 - Can't wait.
 (gentle music)
 This what y'all do, huh?
 Y'all start somebody off real light,
 I just recommend the thing and it's gonna be a smooth ride.
 (laughing)
 - And then the shoe drops.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 This is genius, 'cause this is light right here.
 This is something real light.
 - So your genesis as an artist really reminds me
 of the old school rap blueprint,
 more so than the out of nowhere success stories
 that you hear about on the internet these days.
 Touring your mix tapes,
 selling and pressing your own CDs in school,
 and then building up a local fan base.
 And on your song "Rendezvous,"
 you rap about being eight deep at the show.
 It might only be eight fans.
 Thinking back on those early days of touring,
 what would a nightmare show look like?
 Like what is a show that you remember
 as being a real character builder?
 - So glad you asked.
 A character builder is a perfect way to put it.
 It felt like at one point on my Gazebo tour,
 night after night, I was getting character builders.
 But one that stuck out was the first night of the tour,
 which really set the tone for my expectations.
 It was Birmingham, Alabama.
 There was as many people in the crowd
 as we had come to the venue with.
 And a lot of the nights,
 I liked everybody I brought to mob behind me,
 staying behind the DJ booth.
 So we were literally just looking
 at the same amount of people.
 So I had some humbling shows,
 but they prepared me for this 'cause I had to show out.
 So I think it made me a better performer,
 but I had tons of shows like that.
 - Is it true that you made a song
 with your sixth grade teacher, Mr. Swain?
 - What are you, "Narwar?"
 Here we go.
 Oh my God.
 He just blew my mind, fam.
 Mr. Swain.
 I can't wait till he sees this.
 Yeah, it was my science teacher.
 He was really into rap,
 and he was into the fact that I rapped,
 and I was his student aid.
 So I had a whole period where I would come
 and help him grade papers,
 but really we would just chop it up.
 He was cool as hell.
 Wow.
 He just brought a smile to my face, brother.
 He just warmed my soul up.
 (upbeat music)
 That's delicious.
 That's just plain good.
 - So alongside rappers like Action Bronson and Lil Wayne,
 I'd characterize you as an artist
 who has some of the best, most obscure sports references,
 and you have to be the only rapper ever
 to name-check NFL analyst Adam Schefter.
 When you reference a name like that,
 is that a tip of the cap to that person,
 or is it just a name that fits a particular rhyme scheme?
 - It's both.
 Adam Schefter is like, big salute.
 I like to reference things I grew up on,
 and just like somebody I love for real,
 and I love Adam Schefter.
 I think he's a dope analyst,
 and it did fit the rhyme scheme,
 but I was like, "Damn, this is gonna be fly,
 "'cause it's gonna be a little esoteric."
 You know, if you know, you know.
 He reached out to me too.
 He messaged me, he said his kids showed them their fans of me
 and they were hyped about it.
 I feel like this heat is creeping up in my veins.
 - Yeah.
 - And then what, in your opinion,
 is the most clever Jack Harlow sports reference?
 - I really like the Route 66 one though.
 I really like,
 know my name ring a bell like Raja,
 from the city like Rondo Rajan,
 but I'm from the white side like Hassan.
 I feel like that got slept on.
 I mean, people know about it, but I freestyled that too.
 I was in the booth, I was in Miami,
 and I did that line off the cuff,
 and I remember one of the greatest thrills
 when you're recording is looking through the glass
 and watching the people you're with react
 to the things you're doing live.
 And that's when it becomes a true like performing aspect.
 That's when the swag comes out, everything.
 And just when I said that line,
 and everybody there was like,
 just hard.
 And then I got to see Hassan react to it
 in a post-game interview.
 It was dope.
 Nothing I can't handle, but it's hot.
 How you doing in there, Herb?
 (laughing)
 This is the hottest one so far.
 Pretty sneaky too for a three spot this season.
 That's real.
 It's delicious too.
 Think I'll take another bite.
 So I read a fascinating deep dive analysis
 on Billboard hits over the last 20 years,
 which concluded that songs and song titles
 have gotten significantly shorter in the internet age.
 I've met artists who obsess about industry data watching,
 and then others who don't care at all.
 Where do you fall on that?
 Like, are you somebody who dives into analytics?
 And if so, what information interests you?
 In terms of what people are reacting to,
 I don't want to get too mathematic with the music
 because I'm always trying to push for a feeling.
 And if you intellectualize it too much,
 like you can go in there and suffocate it without a feeling.
 So that's why, you know, that stuff interests me,
 but I wouldn't say I'm somebody that's like keeping up.
 You know what I mean?
 You're an artist who seems picky about production.
 What are some of the non-negotiables or specific things
 that you look for or listen for
 when you're picking out a beat?
 You're a damn good interviewer.
 I'll take it.
 I think what you grow up listening to
 affect the choices you make.
 I have certain grooves and tempos I'm attracted to
 that I think people can see patterns in,
 but I love groovy stuff.
 That's one thing I could say.
 I love things that just got more of a spin to it
 as opposed to like an up and down bounce.
 I like more of a groove, you know what I mean?
 Just smooth stuff.
 That's what I really like.
 What's the secret to a good hip hop ad lib
 and do you have a personal favorite of your own?
 The best ones come totally instinctually.
 So you listening back to the verse
 and you listening to what you said and you're reacting to it.
 That's all it is.
 So I think that's the real secret
 and just finding those pockets where it makes sense.
 Like I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
 I'm not someone that loves putting ad libs
 over top of my vocals.
 And so that's why I don't do a ton of ad libs,
 but I try to pick them where they're selective,
 just stuff that makes sense.
 But I have go-tos.
 My fans always say, "Oof!"
 I do a lot of that.
 And I like to do percussive stuff,
 like stuff that just kinda sounds like a high hat
 or airy stuff.
 Just little stuff that just decorates it a little bit.
 You know what I mean?
 I know what you mean.
 Putting the sauce on it.
 Speaking of, are you ready to move on here to the next one?
 The Los Calientes Barbacoa.
 Hell yeah.
 Let's do it.
 Delicious.
 My lips are hot.
 Might be the best tasting one.
 Damn, Jack.
 Of the four.
 We'll take that.
 You are funny.
 So you are, as you put it,
 a Kentucky boy to the death,
 get it through your head,
 tell it's motherfucking embedded.
 So as to my knowledge,
 the only person that we've ever had representing Louisville,
 we're hoping to get a Jack Harlow city guide
 to Derby City directly from Jack Harlow.
 The Louisville Slugger Museum, overrated or underrated?
 Underrated.
 That's how I feel.
 So if you went to public school in Louisville,
 you took field trips there
 and you'd walk out with a little mini bat.
 So, got a number of love for the Slugger Museum.
 Which is the superior regional soda, Ale-8 or Ski?
 Ale-8, easily.
 I forgot what Ski was when you first said it.
 It's coming back to me now,
 but Ale-8-1 is,
 he's gonna love that.
 My boy in there, listen,
 he's an Ale-8-1 stan.
 Yeah, I grew up with Ale-8-1 in the house,
 so my dad had bottles in the fridge.
 Which is the superior annual event,
 Four Castle or the Great Steamboat Race?
 Depends on your interests, I suppose.
 If you're a steamboat enthusiast,
 it goes without saying, but Four Castle for me,
 I mean, like I grew up going to it
 and wanted to perform at it,
 and then I eventually got to,
 so Hometown Festival is special.
 Who's your all-time favorite
 University of Louisville basketball player and why?
 Terrance Williams.
 Alpha dog confidence, just a fly player,
 like athletic.
 He had a good body, his physique was fire,
 like just a prototypical small forward build.
 I just thought he was dope.
 All right, Jack, are you ready to move on here?
 Halfway mark, Ginger Goat here in the five spot,
 and you're doing great.
 Ginger Goat, eh?
 Let's see what this is heading for.
 Must be ginger in there for real, huh?
 Mm-hmm.
 I bet Urban's liking that.
 Okay, Jack, we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll put the picture up here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Do you have a favorite piece of memorabilia
 or framed plaque on the wall
 when you visited Hitsville, USA?
 I think I saw the Trax and Monteras plaque in there.
 I just liked how the plaques looked a little different
 from how they look now.
 They were a lot more stripped down and minimal.
 Yeah, it was just dope to see how plaques were.
 They're so dressed up now,
 and you know, they have pictures and frames
 and the other achievements included,
 and Spotify stats on them and stuff,
 and it was just like, boom, plaque, fact, over with.
 So it was cool to see those.
 All right, up next, here you are with Cole Bennett.
 Happy birthday, Cole.
 It's today.
 Is it really? It is.
 Shout out to Cole, shout out Lyrical Lemonade.
 What's special about him as a music video director?
 Like, why is he so sought after
 by so many young artists in hip hop?
 For one, he's a tastemaker, so his cosign means a lot,
 and he's broken a lot of artists,
 but aside from that, you know,
 there's some real talent there.
 He blew me away when we shot this video.
 Not to say that I didn't think he was talented
 before we did it, but admittedly,
 I think I was more intrigued by the platform,
 and then I actually worked with him,
 and he put the "What's Poppin'" video together,
 and it was the first video I've ever gotten
 that I got the first draft,
 and I was like, I don't even know what to tell you.
 Like, I don't have no note.
 I'm a note person.
 I'm very particular.
 Like, you're calling me picky.
 I am, so he sent me the "What's Poppin'" video,
 and the first draft, I was like,
 this is gonna change my life.
 I could feel it, and it was crazy,
 so he just has a vision, man.
 He's talented, quality individual.
 Happy birthday.
 Something light.
 Y'all better turn these up, man.
 I'm feeling good.
 (laughing)
 (tapping)
 You are a good man.
 - You say that now, you know.
 - I'm just trying to convince myself of it.
 (laughing)
 'Cause this is hot.
 None of that I can't bear, though.
 Yeah, I'll take another bite.
 - So you once tweeted, "Y'all really don't know.
 "I'm a scenophile.
 "My final form is as a Rotten Tomatoes writer."
 How do you think being an artist yourself
 might affect your perspective as a movie reviewer?
 Like, do you think that as someone
 who's had their own art dissected by music critics,
 do you think that you'd be more deferential to filmmakers,
 or do you think you'd be a savage in the reviews?
 - Huh.
 Hell of a question.
 (sniffing)
 I'd like to think that I would take my perspective with me.
 Sometimes when people talk negative around,
 (scoffing)
 sometimes when people talk negative
 about celebrities around me,
 or they speak on controversies and they have an opinion,
 it irks me 'cause I know how that feels.
 So I think on a similar note,
 I would take that with me.
 With that, I would be like,
 I would think about what it's like to create.
 'Cause sometimes I do look at critics and I'm like,
 "What a dickhead you are."
 - Tell the critics, "Shut up, my show is on."
 - Yeah, I'm like, it takes no bravery to critique.
 Not to say it's not an art, but...
 (sniffing)
 Oh, God.
 Creeps up on you.
 - Which Jack Harlow single do you think would make
 for the best short film adaptation?
 - This should've been a first waiting question.
 What the hell is this about?
 - That's how we stack the deck.
 That's how we stack the deck, Jack.
 - It's becoming more and more Gigi, so see you in the system.
 (thumping)
 - Adaptation of a song.
 None of them.
 Four left, eh?
 - Four left.
 Are you ready to move on to that next one?
 - Yeah, fuck the short film talk.
 Let's keep going.
 - Let's just gas pedal, gas pedal.
 (dramatic music)
 (laughing)
 - Yeah.
 Wait 'til the next one.
 - It looks bad.
 I don't like the complexion of that one.
 - So a lot of debates about the best MCs center on bars,
 but a voice is also a major factor
 in which rappers separate themselves from the pack.
 And I've heard you attribute your own breakthrough
 in the game to finding your voice.
 Can you talk through that evolution?
 - Mystery, bro.
 That milk is not like that.
 - Yeah, the almond doesn't quite hit.
 - It doesn't.
 Yeah.
 I think,
 one, I started before I hit puberty.
 I started literally recording into a mic.
 So I used to get made fun of because you could tell
 my nuts hadn't dropped.
 My voice was so high.
 And so the shift, I got really blessed going into puberty.
 It got deeper.
 I remember Andre 3000 talking about how he was with somebody
 in Organized Noise and he was in the basement.
 He was like, "Bro, stop doing that rap voice.
 Just talk.
 Just say the lyrics.
 Just talk 'em."
 He said he went in the booth and changed everything.
 He said, "They click."
 That's kind of what's happened for me.
 And I'm learning to fine tune it
 because I don't always want it to be conversational.
 You gotta inject energy in the right moments.
 But I found when I started talking,
 the way I'm talking to you on the mic,
 it worked wonders.
 Too much of an inflection is hard to buy into.
 - And you know, it's not uncommon
 if you dig into the crates.
 For a lot of MCs, their early work,
 you'll oftentimes hear a higher pitched tone.
 Is there a reason for that?
 - So I think the deeper voice can represent comfort,
 your comfortability on the record.
 I remember around 2018, people started to say,
 "You sound so comfortable.
 You sound like you don't give a fuck on the song."
 Earlier on, you're trying to prove something.
 You're in that nasal zone.
 You're up here like chip on your shoulder talking.
 Once you get in that comfort zone, you just talking.
 - This next one is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Hey man, don't be talking like that.
 It looks like a problem.
 Look at this thing.
 - Yeah.
 - Stabbing herb.
 - Stabbing.
 - Immediate.
 - That boy's disrespectful.
 That is disrespectful right there.
 Does it hit you different?
 Do you get to a point after doing this
 that it's not as hot as it was the first time?
 - So I think, you know, I'll know what to expect.
 I've eaten this wing for the internet's amusement
 literally 200 times over the last six years.
 So it's not something that I'm not used to or I don't expect,
 but you never get used to Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 Every episode is a labor for me.
 - For the record, can you describe your relationship
 with ranch?
 I saw that you had a whole ranch flavor birthday cake.
 - Wish I had some right now, brother.
 I love ranch.
 Could use it right now.
 Don't know why he didn't have it.
 - Well, you know, when Joey Diaz was on the show,
 he brought blue cheese and he draws a very hard line
 in the sand about how much he cares about blue cheese.
 Meanwhile, when Vince Staples was on the show,
 he brought his own bottle of ranch.
 Do you think that there's a need to pick one side
 of the other blue cheese or ranch or can you go both ways?
 - Hey bro, this is not even fun, bro.
 - Yeah.
 - This is not even.
 - Careful around your eyes.
 Did you catch it?
 - I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Yes.
 - You want to take a break?
 - No, come on.
 - Hell yeah.
 - I said I was going to do this.
 I'm not going to look at you, but I'm going to do it.
 Come on.
 - I got you.
 I got you.
 - Blue, ranch, ranch, ranch.
 That's what you got?
 Oh my God.
 I tried to open it.
 Bro.
 What's special about the Applebee's on Bardstown Road
 and the Highlands?
 - It's 10.
 You can't even tug on my heartstrings right now, brother.
 That would have three wings ago.
 That would have meant a lot to me.
 Are the other two hotter?
 - So here, if you can handle that, you can handle any wing.
 You can handle any wing.
 Do you want to gas pedal it to the next one?
 - Nah, let's talk about Applebee's.
 Come on.
 - Okay.
 Let's talk about Applebee's.
 - We used to go in there.
 We used to go in there and get these decadent shakes.
 And that's not my adjective.
 That's what it said on the menu.
 We used to get these shakes after school,
 after football games.
 We used to be in the booth tormenting the staff.
 Ah, what a time.
 Oh, I can't open my eyes, bro.
 It should have been a conversation
 about not touching the eyes.
 I know it seems like common knowledge,
 but damn, I should have known.
 It's only painful.
 It's not dangerous, right?
 - All right, so this next one.
 - I got one for you.
 My lazy eye too.
 I can't fucking see.
 - Well, this next one.
 - Since birth.
 Go ahead.
 - If you can't, with the eye patch,
 you used to have the eye patch over there.
 - You're on your shit.
 You are a man.
 My God, you blow up my mind today.
 - Yeah, and your eye and everything.
 - Come on, what you got?
 - So this next one is the scorpion disco in the nine spot.
 - What a fucking man.
 Oh my, I gotta stop looking at things.
 - Yeah.
 - You want me to eat this for a...
 - Only if you do.
 - Oh my God.
 - So I know that video games have been a part of your life
 since the very beginning,
 back when you used to record your earliest tracks
 on the USB microphone that they give you with Guitar Hero.
 - Yeah.
 - And you're featured on that Call of Duty trailer
 where you crash a helicopter with AC/DC's Thunderstruck
 driving the background music.
 How do you distill the experience
 of doing your own stunts on that shoot?
 - Well, they put me on a cable with Drewski
 and that was a unique experience
 to be able to say I did cable work.
 Lifted me up, dropped me down, green screen.
 It was overall a wonderful experience.
 - Is there an onstage stunt that you're most proud of?
 Like a balcony dive or crowd surfing episode
 that you remember like it was yesterday?
 - One time I staged of,
 I did a show when I was a senior in high school
 and I sold it out like a 300 cap.
 And I dove off the stage, but the stage was three feet tall.
 I hurt this girl's head, landed on her, felt bad.
 She wasn't badly hurt, but it was like a bad attempt.
 Haven't done nothing since, no reckless.
 - All right, Jack Harlow.
 What do you want? Come on.
 (dramatic music)
 - This is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing.
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 - I want to.
 - Whoa!
 - I won't eat all of it.
 - Please don't.
 - Was there a dab or a lot?
 - Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot.
 - All right, brother.
 No one's going to tell me I didn't go through this.
 - You went through it like a soldier.
 And thankfully, and thankfully Jack Harlow,
 we've reached the epilogue of our spicy feast together.
 We've talked about your career,
 the scenophile side of Jack Harlow,
 and your love of ranch.
 - Hey.
 - I know that no matter where this industry takes you,
 forever your home will be Kentucky.
 So with that in mind,
 I want to play a quick name association game
 where I'll shout out some of the sauces
 that we've had on the gauntlet today.
 And you just tell me the first famous Kentuckian
 that comes to mind.
 Scorpion Disco.
 - Jennifer Lawrence.
 - The Last Dab Apollo.
 The one that you just ate.
 - Johnny Depp.
 Just sounds classic.
 - Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Static Major. Rest in peace.
 - And then the classic.
 - George Clooney.
 - Well, there you have it.
 A gauntlet for the ages with Jack Harlow.
 Somehow, some way he made it through all the way to the end.
 And now Jack, there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you, my friend.
 This camera, that camera, that camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - You see it.
 You see it.
 Cyclops.
 Listen, man.
 That's what they all say. My debut album out now.
 No regrets. I'm happy I did this.
 It's no bitch.
 I thought it was gonna be,
 I thought it was gonna be less than what it was.
 It's everything, no more.
 - Great job. Great job.
 - I got my best friend in the green room.
 When we were still in high school, I think,
 he showed me this.
 He's like, "Man, one day you're gonna do this."
 I'm talking four years ago, maybe five.
 I don't know, right around when this started.
 He's like, "One day we're gonna do this."
 And I said, "Okay, when we do it,
 "you gotta eat 'em with me."
 So I think they're taking him some wings in the green room
 to eat and line stuff with me.
 So this is, I really wanna say,
 this is a dream come true, for real.
 We manifested this moment,
 so I'm really excited to be here.
 - I'm happy that I can share it with you.
 - Hell yeah.
 (grunts)
 (dramatic music)
