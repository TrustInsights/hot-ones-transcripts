 There you go.
 Yeah.
 That just went, "Rrrr."
 [LAUGHTER]
 That just dropped in.
 [MUSIC]
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 Today, we're joined by Lenny Kravitz.
 He's a four-time Grammy Award-winning singer,
 songwriter, and one of the seminal rock artists of a generation,
 selling more than 40 million records worldwide
 over the course of his storied music career.
 You can also catch him starring alongside Jennifer Lopez
 in the new film Shotgun Wedding, which is now available on Prime Video.
 Lenny Kravitz, welcome to the show.
 How you doing, man?
 I'm doing good.
 And you know why I'm doing good?
 Tell me.
 It's a historical day in Hot Ones history,
 the first time that we've ever bridged the generational divide
 with our guests.
 Your daughter, Zoe Kravitz, did Hot Ones almost three years ago to the day,
 with ease, I might add.
 What's going through your mind as you prepare to take on the gauntlet?
 And did you by chance reach out to her for any tips?
 I watched her episode.
 I had to study it.
 I'm hoping that since we come from the same lineage--
 Same blood, same pedigree.
 --it's going to be all right.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Over here?
 Yeah.
 What are these?
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Got some weird fake chicken.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 That's good.
 There we go.
 Yeah.
 Light, little fruitiness.
 Give you some confidence going in.
 You know, I can handle this.
 I can handle this.
 But I know that there's a game to this.
 You do that on purpose.
 The other shoe waiting for it to drop.
 Right.
 So your latest project, Shotgun Wedding,
 tells the story of a picturesque wedding ceremony
 that gets taken over by pirates.
 And they turn this picturesque ceremony
 into a full-blown hostage crisis.
 And your role is a pretty physical one,
 from the fight scenes to the shootouts
 to the high-stakes parasailing.
 In playing Sean, what did you find
 to be the most challenging thing and what was most rewarding?
 The most challenging thing definitely were the stunts.
 I've never done stunts before.
 And they had an amazing stunt team,
 guys that worked on James Bond, actually, the Batman as well.
 So I had to learn fight routines,
 do these routines up in the parachute, on water,
 on the boats.
 But it was fun.
 And we had a great team.
 It was very safe and very well organized.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 What's on top?
 It's kind of like a ranch-inspired sauce.
 And then you get a little tahini in there.
 So unique flavor and unique color here for our lineup.
 I'm waiting.
 Yeah, that's a smart man right there, smart man.
 Of all the guitars that you own, is there
 one that you describe as your holy grail,
 either because of the backstory that it has
 or your sentimental attachment to it?
 There's a guitar that Robert Plant gave me
 at the end of our tour.
 During my Are You Going to Go My Way tour in '93, '94,
 Robert Plant opened for me, which makes absolutely no sense
 whatsoever.
 But he had a new solo record.
 And he wanted to go out and play for the younger generation.
 And he gave me a beautiful Les Paul Jr. that he signed.
 Well, he didn't sign it.
 He gave me this case that had a brass plaque on it.
 And it said, "To Lenny, thanks for the ride, Robert."
 It's very special to me.
 Hell yeah.
 And then off the top of your head,
 without thinking about it too much,
 which song has the best guitar lick?
 Ever?
 Ever.
 Wow, that's-- there's a lot.
 But I would say that Purple Haze, Jimi Hendrix,
 is quite strong and really quite original.
 Donis Kadeho.
 Mm-hmm.
 Nice little kick.
 Mm-hmm.
 I feel this is like first time we take kind of a step up,
 you know?
 She's hot.
 Yep.
 Yeah.
 She's hot.
 There we go.
 There we go.
 So back in 2003, you founded a design firm, Kravitz Design,
 in part because you couldn't find furniture
 to fit your aesthetic, so decided
 to start making it yourself.
 Who makes the best coffee tables?
 Like, is there someone that you look at as like the Zeppelin
 of coffee tables?
 I'm actually in the market for a coffee table.
 The Zeppelin of coffee tables.
 There's a lot.
 There's an amazing woman by the name of Gabriella Crespi,
 gentleman by the name of Willie Rizzo, Paul Evans.
 These are some of my favorite designers
 that make really beautiful, sexy coffee tables that
 are art, essentially.
 All right, one's got to go, design edition, all right?
 So you got to cross one off.
 One's got to go.
 Mid-century, modern, bohemian, or farmhouse?
 The farmhouse will have to go, then.
 Farmhouse aesthetic.
 If you're making me get rid of something.
 But you love them all.
 Absolutely.
 There's a place for everything.
 Just like the wings so far, all hitting, all working for you.
 Are you ready to move on to sauce number four?
 This is the Los Calientes Verde here in the four spot.
 Los Calientes.
 Mm-hmm.
 Nice flavor.
 I like that.
 And the heat is smooth.
 Love to hear that.
 Smooth finish.
 Yeah.
 Do you have a favorite sauce so far?
 That's one of them, actually.
 Yeah.
 We'll take that.
 We'll take that.
 And the first one was nice if you want something very simple,
 but nice flavor.
 So you have a unique perspective.
 Having grown up in New York at the birth of hip hop,
 what do you remember about the first time
 that you encountered it?
 And what was your initial reaction?
 The first time I encountered hip hop
 was on my block in Bed-Stuy on Kosciusko Street,
 one of our neighbors was in his front yard
 with two turntables, homemade speakers.
 I didn't quite understand what was happening,
 because he was talking about making music.
 But I was like, you're playing records.
 Then it happened.
 It all clicked.
 And I understood.
 But it was really beautiful before it was on the radio,
 before it became commercial, to see it
 on the block in the street with my neighbors.
 Yeah, well, at ground zero being in Bed-Stuy.
 Yeah.
 So you have the Bronx, you have Brooklyn.
 And so I got the Brooklyn side of it.
 Another MC in the GOAT conversation
 that you're closely associated with is Jay-Z.
 What would you say distinguishes his style in the studio?
 Every time I've worked with him, and I
 know that this is the way he works in general,
 is there's no pen and paper.
 He listens to the track.
 You put it on, you blast the track,
 and he sits there at the console, puts his head down,
 play it again, play it again, maybe two or three times,
 and then goes in and just gives you perfection.
 It's really beautiful to watch.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Oh, Brooklyn, OK.
 That's a nice flavor, too.
 Yeah.
 Kind of has like a--
 Oh, but then the heat--
 --masala base.
 Yep.
 The heat sneaks up on you, though.
 It's good.
 Whoa.
 You like that?
 Yeah, and as you said it, I felt like--
 you ever catch a flake?
 You know?
 Oh, yeah.
 Inhale.
 Oh, yeah.
 And just finds a spot.
 Because in the Bahamas, we do a lot of--
 like for instance, we have this dish called
 boiled fish, which is something that's
 very popular for breakfast, especially
 after a night out partying.
 And basically, it's this fish grouper,
 and they boil it in its water, onions, herbs,
 and different things, and they cut the peppers that go in it.
 So we have these peppers called bird peppers.
 And basically, you just take it, and you
 use your knife or your spoon, and you just
 keep scraping on the side of the bowl, and you put it in there.
 And then you have those pieces that are--
 Can come loose.
 Pretty hardcore.
 [LAUGHS]
 Yeah.
 All right, Lane Kravitz, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram, where
 we do a deep dive on our guests' Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll show you the picture over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 How did the music of James Brown enter your life,
 and what do you remember about meeting him for the first time?
 So that was at the VH1 Fashion Awards.
 We did Papa's Got a Brand New Bag together.
 And it was really wonderful, because he knew me,
 but he didn't know me.
 So we did this tune, and he liked what I was doing.
 And we were done.
 He said, if you keep doing this, you're going to get somewhere.
 But it was really pure and really beautiful.
 But the first time I saw him play live
 was when I was about six or seven years old
 at the Apollo Theater.
 I still remember.
 I still remember the way it felt, the smells, the colors.
 Everything was deep purples and maroons and dark greens.
 It was just really beautiful.
 And then you have one of those original Godfather
 of Soul suits, right?
 How do you know that?
 I do.
 Yeah, there's a jumpsuit, a denim jumpsuit.
 That was from the Rumble in the Jungle,
 with black stretchy material here.
 But James was wearing that outfit.
 And I got it at auction after James passed.
 Can you give us a trade secret when
 it comes to the art of the Super Bowl halftime shows?
 In what ways is it a uniquely singular experience
 for a performer?
 Well, actually, they made me change my shirt right
 before we were going out.
 I was already in the tunnel, lined up,
 getting ready to go out, and they made me change my shirt.
 Why'd they want you to change your shirt?
 Well, actually, they made me put on a shirt.
 I just had on the leather jacket that you see there.
 I don't know.
 Maybe they didn't want the bear chest.
 They seem to have a problem with nipples.
 They don't play with the nipples.
 They don't play with the nipples in the halftime show.
 All right, one more for you.
 As an avid photographer, is there a collection
 or a single photo you're most proud to have taken?
 I was very close with a gentleman
 by the name of Herman Leonard, who
 happens to be the grandfather of Zoe's friend, Skye.
 Who was at the shoot.
 Yes, you remember, obviously.
 You brought her on afterwards.
 So Herman Leonard was a master photographer
 who shot the jazz world.
 Pictures of Dexter Gordon with the sax with all the smoke
 around, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and so forth.
 And he came down and hung out with his family.
 And I took the last portrait of him,
 which is very special to me and was a great honor.
 And he was just a beautiful, beautiful human being.
 Mushroom.
 Mm-hmm.
 What's the mushroom part?
 There's like-- there's mushrooms in it?
 Mm-hmm.
 Got some portobello.
 Portobello.
 Portobello's in there.
 There you go.
 That just-- that just went, rrrr.
 That just dropped in.
 The mushroom mayhem, you know.
 Is there an album of yours or even a single song
 that you'd say went through the biggest evolution
 from what it started as to what it ultimately
 ended up becoming?
 Mm.
 There's always those couple of songs per record
 that don't happen as quickly as the others
 and take time because I'm very much into also
 the art of recording.
 So the tune might be right, but I
 don't like the sound of the snare drum
 or I don't like the sound of the bass
 or I want to try a different microphone on that vocal.
 On the "Are You Going to Go My Way" album,
 there's a track called "Believe" that just kept going and going
 and going and I kept rerecording different instruments and all.
 But everything might work.
 And one thing then goes on top that doesn't,
 and then it tears the whole house down below you.
 So you have to figure out which elements you want to keep
 and what you want to replace.
 And that's a whole dance, you know?
 A puzzle and a sculpture at the same time.
 That's what it is.
 Crafting, creating, making music.
 So this next one is "The Dream of Calypso."
 "The Dream of Calypso."
 It's Angry Goats' "Dreams of Calypso."
 Do you like that name?
 It seems like you'd like that name.
 Ooh.
 Where's that from?
 It's actually from Vermont.
 "Dreams of Calypso" from Vermont.
 "Dreams of Calypso" from Vermont.
 [LAUGHS]
 Woo.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 Different level.
 Yeah, that's some dragon shit right there.
 Yeah, fire.
 We're flying.
 We're flying now.
 Yeah.
 This one mellows.
 After it peaks, it mellows down.
 Yeah, it makes a lot of noise up front.
 Yeah.
 But it doesn't do that thing where it kind of just
 continues to build on you.
 But OK, there it goes.
 Yeah, right.
 [LAUGHS]
 There it goes to the front of the tongue now.
 Just when you think you have it figured out, you know?
 Yeah.
 What do you think you learned going
 to music clubs like the Odyssey?
 How do you think that kind of shaped
 your attitude as a rock star?
 That was a really cool place.
 I used to sneak out at night and go there
 and come back home like 5 in the morning and then go to school.
 So this is like during Beverly Hills High Days?
 Stealing my parents' car, yeah, which was a whole operation.
 Stealing that car.
 Because I had to enter my parents' room,
 crawl on the carpet to the side of my parents' bed
 on my dad's side.
 Then there was this little closet.
 I had to get in that closet.
 And then I had to feel on all the different shelves,
 get the keys, close the door, get back down on my hands
 and knees, crawl back out, and go.
 That took about literally 20 minutes to steal the keys.
 And then I would have to put the car in reverse and push.
 It was a whole thing.
 Yeah, yeah, get out.
 I wanted to go to the Odyssey and hang out.
 And it was incredible.
 It was new wave, new romantics, music, fashion.
 And yeah, that was kind of like a home for me for a while.
 So this next one is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 Sometimes I'm caught in sort of an ethical tug of war.
 Like, should I warn guests about this?
 Should I not?
 Right.
 We're just driving--
 Oh, it's hot.
 Immediately.
 Oof.
 Nothing fun about it either.
 Like, remember on the last sauce, like, oh, it's hot.
 Right.
 But you're like, oh, but I kind of like it.
 Kind of delicious.
 This, there's nothing fun about it.
 No.
 Hot on the throat.
 Yeah.
 Oh.
 Damn.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 And it doesn't stop.
 Nah.
 But the taste.
 What do I got?
 So this is from you.
 I don't drink milk, so--
 and I don't like fake milk.
 I don't like anything trying to be milk.
 Right, right.
 No imitation of milk.
 I had a thing about milk as a kid.
 It's from natural lemonade over here.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 That one's just nasty.
 Yeah.
 That's not even, like, for food.
 You know what I mean?
 No, no.
 That's just to fuck with people.
 No.
 Yeah, exactly.
 It's just for this moment in this show.
 For this audience, right.
 But keeping your cool, I have to say.
 Not that I should expect anything else, but--
 I'm Zoey's dad.
 Mm-hmm.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Yeah.
 That's some hot sauce.
 You're telling me.
 You're telling me.
 You like that?
 No, but I mean, I don't know.
 It's just-- it's like a cross that I bear at this point.
 You know, like, even Zoey, when she did it three years ago,
 she went in on this one too.
 You know, it just stays here.
 You have found your niche, bro.
 At this point, I could probably get the sauce off the table.
 But I choose to keep it here because of this, like for this.
 Right?
 So when you say, like, do you enjoy it?
 No, but for whatever reason, it does have to stay here.
 You know what I mean?
 I don't know how to parse those things.
 Do you have a Mount Rushmore of tropical fruits?
 Tropical fruits?
 Yeah.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I like you, man.
 Coconut.
 There you go.
 I drink coconut water every day and eat coconut off my trees.
 Soursop.
 Which you grow outside the trailer.
 Which is really, really healthy and delicious.
 Sugar apples, which they're not apples.
 It's a Caribbean fruit.
 Guavas.
 Mangos.
 That's it.
 Those are my favorites.
 How you feeling, bro?
 You know what?
 I'm doing good if you're doing good.
 You know what I mean?
 I'm fine.
 Sometimes I feel like I'm a North Star for the guests.
 Now Lenny Kravitz, I'm following you.
 But your eyes are all watery.
 I'm following you.
 I'm following you.
 You know?
 If you're ready to move on to the next one, I am.
 Damn.
 OK.
 [LAUGHTER]
 OK, what does that mean?
 These are for tacos?
 Tacos from hell.
 Mm-hmm.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 I got to go to a premiere after this.
 Very brave.
 So like most cool people, you've had the label thrust upon you
 without using it to ever describe yourself.
 Do you think that there is anything
 that you did as a dad to embarrass Zoe as a kid?
 Because you know, it is kind of funny to think about kids
 groaning at a rock star parent.
 But ultimately, that has to be a universal experience
 for everybody.
 I think I still continue to embarrass her.
 [LAUGHTER]
 You know, it's when she was young, you know,
 and I had to pick her up from school and things like that.
 Some of the clothes that I wore, I don't think
 she was too happy with that.
 You know?
 I think she would have liked me to blend in a little more.
 You know?
 All right, Lenny Kravitz.
 What's this?
 Oh, what happens now?
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 So this is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab.
 Because it's tradition around here to put a little extra
 on the last wing.
 You don't have to--
 What?
 --if you don't want to.
 Extra?
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 As though that wasn't enough.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 All right, let's see.
 Let's put a little taste.
 Here you go.
 Just a little bit.
 Here, rub it in.
 Yep.
 All right.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 We doing this?
 Cheers, Lenny.
 All right, my brother.
 What a ride.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 10 wings up and 10 wings down, Lenny Kravitz.
 And to close things out, you're a musician whose music fuses
 everything from R&B, pop, funk, jazz.
 But at the end of the day, you really
 are like an axe-wielding rock star in its truest form.
 So to close things out, I'm curious.
 Are you more optimistic or less optimistic about the next great
 rock renaissance?
 More optimistic, because there's so many kids learning
 to play guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, horns, instruments.
 All these kids coming up and they're playing.
 And they really appreciate the music that came before them.
 And so I think in the years to come, it will explode again.
 Well, a standing ovation for Lenny Kravitz.
 All right, brother.
 Thank you for coming in here, taking on the wings of death,
 doing Zoey Proud, the first father-daughter duo to ever
 take on the Hot Ones gauntlet.
 20 wings up, 20 wings down.
 And now there's nothing left to do but roll out
 the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 What I have going on in my life?
 We have Shotgun Wedding, which is going to start
 streaming on the 27th of January.
 I've got three albums in the can.
 We're going to start releasing music mid-year.
 And I'll be back for a world tour starting at the end of the year.
 [CLAPPING]
 All right.
 Thank you, brother.
 Thank you.
 That's the Hot Ones experience.
 That was great.
 Did you have a good time?
 Yeah, man.
 That was awesome.
 It was just the bomb.
 But that's not even--
 it's just you feel it on your mouth, that's all.
 That was good.
 And now you're ready to go to this premiere.
 Absolutely.
 Now you're going to have a pep in the step.
 Absolutely.
 That was great.
 Thank you for having me.
 Thank you.
 Really appreciate it.
 Damn.
