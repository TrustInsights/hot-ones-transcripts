 I got dudes in the industry, I just want to sit them down and make them do this and ask them questions.
 I'm with you, bro. You're the smartest dude that ever lived.
 Hey, what's going on, everybody? For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings. And today we're joined by LL Cool J.
 He's a two-time Grammy Award-winning artist, hip-hop trailblazer, and recent inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
 which really only tells half the story, with decades of TV and film credits as well, from NCIS to Toys to any given Sunday.
 He also founded Rock the Bells, his media company, and Sirius Radio Channel, which of course celebrates classic hip-hop.
 LL Cool J, welcome to the show.
 Thanks for having me, man.
 What's going through your head as you prepare to take on this gauntlet today?
 I'm terrified, B. I don't know what's happening. This is all these hot stuff. I didn't expect all this.
 There's a lot of different brands, labels. I kind of, I seen the show, but I didn't really realize the, you know what I mean?
 Yeah, the scale of it, when it meets you right here.
 Especially me, because this is like exactly what I'm avoiding at the restaurant. Like, I'm moving right past this section.
 Got it. Okay. Let's do it.
 That's hot enough, B.
 That's hot enough right there. Like, I could go home.
 Oh, man.
 Well, goddamn.
 Woo!
 That's stage one?
 That's stage one.
 We're in for one today.
 We are. And with Fowlis, I'm a little hungry and I'm tempted to go for it a little more, but I'm gonna ease into it.
 Yeah, we'll pace it. We'll pace it. We'll pace it.
 Okay.
 So you're just coming off the Grammys, where you introduced and performed in the star-studded tribute to hip-hop's 50th anniversary.
 Right.
 As someone who's won multiple Grammys, hosted the show on five different occasions, where did last Sunday's performance rank amongst your most treasured Grammy memories?
 It's probably the most enjoyable. One of the most enjoyable. I mean, I've had other moments hosting, just purely hosting, that were amazing as well.
 But as an artist, I mean, this was like by far the most fun for me. I mean, being on stage with Rakim and Public Enemy and Salt-N-Pepa, Grandmaster Flash, Milly Mouse, Sculpt, Raheem.
 I just want people to know that, you know, for years, hip-hop has been being served in a brown paper bag, a greasy brown paper bag. I wanted people to, I wanted it to be served on a silver platter.
 And, you know, thankfully it was. I was able to, you know, make a huge contribution. Questlove did a wonderful job curating. Jesse did an amazing job producing, you know, making sure the production was right.
 And, you know, me just sewing things together, making sure things are right, really helping to mold it and make it what it is. And I think it turned out to be something real special for hip-hop.
 Who is your favorite artist?
 Shaquanda. She ain't gonna come out. She ain't gonna jump out the curtains or nothing.
 Yeah, okay. Okay.
 Still got our feet. Yeah, I'm okay. There we go. I'm okay. There we go. My tongue is like, attentive right now. You know? Head on a swing.
 My tongue is waiting for interception right now. Like, you know, when you're on offense, you gotta keep your head on a swivel looking out for interception.
 If there's interception, that's how my tongue feels right now. It's just like, you know, my tongue has a chubby.
 You know, not all the way there, but it's, you know what I mean? It's ready. It's ready. There for you. A little tongue chubby right now. Okay.
 So when we had Queen Latifah on the show, she reminisced about performing at LA roller rinks turned music venues like Skateland and Roll Down Wheels.
 Yeah. What role did places like The Rink in North Jersey play in your own hip-hop origin story?
 Oh man, The Rink was incredible. I mean, that was one of the first places I ever played at was The Rink.
 Because that was back then when we didn't have music video. So I only had like, I Need a Beat Out with The Rink.
 That built, I feel punch drunk right now. It's like, you know what I mean? Speed bag in my lips right now. My lips is getting speed bagged.
 I can't even focus, B. Yeah, The Rink. So I went out there and fuck it, man. I don't know what I'm talking about, B. Whatever.
 Whatever it was, whatever I was going to say, it was going to be smart and provocative and introspective.
 What do you remember about hearing I Need a Beat for the first time at the game room on Farmers Boulevard?
 I mean, it was an amazing feeling too. Like, imagine if your dream was like a big giant bubble, right?
 And it was coming towards you and you had the ability to pull it in. And it's your dream.
 So you have a hand in it and it's your dream. So I'm out there, I'm staring at the ground.
 You know, it had rained earlier that day, but, you know, I'm out there and this dude comes up to me and he's like, "Yo, that's you on the radio."
 And I remember staring at the street, the street lights, it was dark. And I was like, "Yeah, I know. I like that."
 It's like, "I like that." You know, the light was glistening like diamonds off the street. It was like, it was an unbelievable moment.
 I'm right there with you. I'm right there with you. And if you're right there with me, are you ready to move on here?
 Yeah, let's do it. To sauce number three. Let's do it. So this is the Donas Cadejo here. The Donas Cadejo?
 Mm-hmm. Like, God damn, like in Donas Gadejo? Donas Gadejo.
 It's getting hot in here. Getting, getting, getting, getting hot in here. Getting hot in here.
 Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot. You know what I mean? God damn, B.
 Right there, right there. Factor Fiction. An animatronic shark's grasp onto your left leg almost caused you to drown on the set of Deep Blue Sea.
 Thousand percent true. Facts. Hundred percent facts. I was on the set, you know what I mean? I was probably number 479 on the call sheet.
 And, you know, I was, you know, in the middle of a take and lunch and the guy holding the, you know, the little toe, the little joystick, you know, pastami, you know, and they just, you know, broke.
 They just bailed on me. And there I was just like, it was like real. And they said, oh, and they gave me this little breathing thing, this little breathing apparatus, like something like this, you know, and you blow out, then breathe in.
 I blew out, breathed in, all water. Took it to another level. But I ended up struggling getting out. And when I got out, climbed out, there was one dude sitting there with a cigarette like.
 I saw what happened.
 You know what I mean? So it was cool.
 Los Calientes Verdes.
 Ooh.
 God damn.
 Going through it.
 Going back to Cali. Caliente. Going back to Cali.
 Fuck.
 Going back to Caliente. Caliente.
 Damn, B.
 What are some of the biggest differences in navigating the music industry versus Hollywood?
 Like, I don't think it's a coincidence that the hip hop icons have had this enduring, everlasting legacy on the big screen also happen to be some of the most business savvy.
 Discipline equals freedom.
 You know, the music industry, man, is a wonderful business, and it can be a wonderful business.
 But the reality is not many people are very disciplined.
 You make it to the gold chain. Now what?
 You make it to the diamond neck brace. Now what?
 You know what I'm saying? And so it's the discipline.
 And the guys that you see that are successful and the women that you see that are successful, the people that you see that are successful, they're disciplined.
 Like I always tell my staff and my team, it's like, it's corny and it sounds cheesy, but it's true. Ego is not your amigo.
 You know what I'm saying? Humility is a superpower.
 Okay.
 This right here, Brooklyn deli ghost pepper sauce.
 Yeah, different kind of.
 Yeah, that motherfucker, that boy.
 Yeah, yeah.
 That motherfucker, that boy.
 That's a step up.
 That shit ain't playing at all. No level.
 That shit.
 You're talking to me.
 You walk in the house, that shit put you in a headlock.
 Sit the fuck down. I run this.
 I run this shit, B.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Holy mackerel.
 Yeah.
 Going in.
 All right, Alla Cool J, we have a recurring segment on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram, pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 Okay.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Okay.
 What's the origin story behind meeting Rick Rubin for the first time at his NYU dorm room?
 14 years old, I was trying to get a record deal.
 And I went, you know what I'm saying, to a record store called Record Explosion.
 I used to go and buy, either buy or if I had money, or just copy down the addresses of any song that looked like it was hip hop or I knew was hip hop.
 So I would either buy them or write them down and send demos out.
 And I did that for like two years.
 And I finally bought It's Yours by Tila Rock.
 It had Def Jam Productions.
 The logo was on the label, it was Streetwise Party Time and they had the Def Jam logo.
 I called Rick.
 I didn't know it was his dorm room at the time, but I used to call him all the time.
 Every day, every day, every day, every day.
 And, "Yo, Rick, you get the tape yet?"
 "Nope."
 Call him the next day, "Rick, you get the tape yet?"
 "Nope."
 "Rick, you get the tape yet?"
 And finally, Ad Rock from the Beastie Boys, he heard my tape and he played it for Rick.
 And then Rick called me and, you know, the rest is history.
 Here we are, like, you know, Hall of Fames and Grammys and it's crazy, man.
 First time I met him, I said, when I walked in, I was like, "Oh, shit, you Rick?"
 He said, "Yeah."
 I said, "I thought you was black."
 He said, "Cool."
 I thought he was black too.
 He's like, "Yo, what's up? It's Rick."
 I'm like, "I thought it was, you know, Rick."
 I was expecting Frankie Crocker to come out that motherfuckin' you know what I mean?
 You know?
 You know?
 You know what I mean?
 I expected, you know, Don Cornelius.
 You know what I mean?
 I thought Don Cornelius was going to come downstairs, bro.
 Mushroom mayhem.
 Mushroom mayhem.
 Are these mushrooms going to make all these colors become vivid?
 Is this the kind of mayhem we talk about?
 There's only one way to tell, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed, you know?
 All right.
 That it will happen.
 Yeah.
 [Music]
 Yep.
 In it.

 Yeah.
 Oh, man.

 That sounds like a hit.
 Get a mullet cut.
 Little mushroom mayhem.
 Little dude with a mullet.
 Do you remember what felt like your first, like, big money show?
 Like, do you remember your first $10,000 show or your first $1,000 show?
 I mean, the first show for $300 was a big money.
 Yeah.
 Are you kidding me?
 Like, what?
 What?
 Yo, listen.
 Let me tell you something.
 First of all, I started when I was 16.
 All I wanted at that time was a VCR, a gold chain, and some sneakers.
 My first check that I ever got that to me was a lot of money was $50,000.
 First thing I did was buy my mother a car.
 And then I gave my mother, like, I don't know, 10 or 8 grand or something, and I took the
 rest.
 And I just remember all my shit being gone and my mother still having to 8 grand in the
 car.
 I'm like, what?
 I didn't really understand what happened here.
 You know what I mean?
 It was just like, what happened?
 But you grow up and you learn.
 I can get a chicken wing if I need one.
 You know what I'm saying?
 I'm doing okay.
 I'm blessed.
 So it's all good.
 All right.
 All right.
 This next one is the dreams of Calypso here.
 Shout out to Harry Belafonte.
 Oh my God, bro.
 Hey, damn.
 That is so crazy.
 It's like a like an aluminum foil rose is blooming in my throat.
 That is hot.
 A beautiful way to put it.
 A beautiful way to put it.
 Wow.
 So you signed to Def Jam in 1984.
 Yeah.
 Go for it.
 Go for it.
 Oh, shit.
 I don't even like milk like that.
 He needs your milk.
 Any port in a storm.
 Any port in a storm.
 No, I ain't going that far with that.
 Oh, fuck.
 Wow.
 Would Cardi see that dangly thing in my throat?
 This shit hit that dangly thing in your throat, Cardi.
 This right here.
 You know, this shit crazy.
 So you signed to Def Jam in 1984 and you've successfully navigated the notoriously treacherous
 music industry alongside some of the biggest titans in the game.
 So if you'll humor me, what I want to do is just a thought association game where I hit
 you with a rap tycoon and you just give me the first couple of thoughts that come to your
 mind.
 Okay.
 Ler Colin.
 Smart.
 I think he's smart.
 I think he's, um, he's only going to do what he has to.
 Love you Ler.
 He's only going to do what he has to be.

 Brilliant.
 Brilliant guy.
 Gone too soon.
 That's my friend.
 Loved him.

 Ahead of his time.
 Good guy.
 Oh my God.

 That shit is in the pipes.
 Yeah.

 Clogged pipes.
 God damn.
 I got dudes in the industry.
 I just want to sit them down and make them do this and ask them questions.
 I'm with you bro.
 You're the smartest dude that ever lived with this shit.
 This shit is crazy.
 Nobody's smarter than you B with this shit.
 What's the name of this one?
 This is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 Probably for the best.
 Yeah.
 That was good.
 That's good.
 For the first time, a calm in the room.
 And I am telling you, I'm not going.
 Yo, this shit here.
 Yeah.

 We conquered.
 And you know, you're one of hip hop's great ambassadors from the music that shifted the
 landscape to rock the bells, which continues to honor classic hip hop to your most recent
 Grammy performance, which of course was a toast to the 50th anniversary.
 So to close things out with your brain on fire, your mouth ablaze, how would you best
 distill what hip hop has meant to you?
 Like, what is your love letter to the genre?
 >> Well, I'll tell you like this.
 First of all, you know, just because of where I grew up and where I was raised, if I wasn't
 doing hip hop, you know, it'd have been, you know, either the military, bank robbery or
 drug dealing.
 One of them three.
 When I was a little kid, when I was in my twenties, it was about me taking my shirt
 off and making it about me.
 Now it's about looking out at the culture and elevating all of these artists and making
 sure that this culture is celebrated the way it should be and the way I believe it should
 be.
 And that's been, that's my life's mission with rock the bells.
 That's why rock the bells are so important to me and is, has become the go-to company
 for all people who, fuck my mouth is hot.
 Oh God, I can't even get my spiel.
 I had to elevate it.
 It's down, bro.
 It's over.
 Rock the bells is hot.
 Shit.
 You know what I mean?
 This is just check it out.
 Go to the.com.
 Check it out.
 Shit's hot.
 You know what I mean?
 We're not corny.
 We're not, it ain't dusty as fly.
 Fuck it.
 Mike drop and look at you.
 L Cool J taking on the wings of death and living to tell the tale.
 Now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera, let the people know what you have going on in
 your life.
 All right.
 Well right now, um, I have a new album coming out this year, a new record produced by Q-Tip
 of a tribe called Quest, rock the bells as a company, as a culture company.
 We have content, commerce and experiences, you know what I'm saying?
 And we doing it.
 So that's what I'm doing.
 God damn.
 My mouth is hot.
 My mouth is hot.
 My man, appreciate you, bro.
 I appreciate you, man.
 Wow.
 That was crazy, B. Wow.
 Crazier than you thought it would be.
 Are you kidding me?
 Hell yeah.
