 (dramatic music)
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 (laughing)
 No!
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Salma Hayek-Pineau.
 She's an Academy Award nominated actress and film producer
 who for decades has been a Hollywood icon
 and leading box office draw.
 From Desperado to Frida to the Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
 and many more.
 Her latest though is the highly anticipated
 Marvel Studios release Eternals,
 which is set to theaters on November 5th.
 Salma Hayek, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you.
 Very excited to be here.
 - And then I know that you're a fan of Valentina hot sauce,
 but how are you around spicy food in general?
 - I'm okay with hot food.
 I'm Mexican.
 I'm Mexican.
 I've been on a break from alcohol and hot food
 for about three months.
 So let's see if my tongue has forgotten,
 you know, what it's like and, you know,
 how to endure the hotness.
 We will do the test.
 (dramatic music)
 - Mm.
 Mm.
 Oh, it's good.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 It's very good.
 I'm a little bit nervous because I was under the impression
 like the first one is not hot at all.
 - Yeah.
 But a little bit of a kick,
 little bit of a kick. - But it's hot.
 It's hot.
 I'm terrified how it's gonna get.
 But it's really good.
 - Yeah, and you're going back in.
 You're going back in.
 So as we've touched on, you play Ajak in "Eternals,"
 the spiritual leader of an immortal team of superheroes.
 And recently, director Chloe Zhao told a story
 about you waiting out a production delay,
 lost in your headphones,
 listening to the atmospheric Nils Fromm song "Says."
 And it made me curious, what role, if any,
 does music play in helping you
 to get into a character like Ajak?
 - Like every character, it's so important in my life.
 And it makes my job really fun
 because I do my own score for the character,
 and it keeps me staying the vibe.
 And it really puts you in your own little micro universe
 where anything can happen.
 And everything, it's enhanced, like the trees, the lights,
 everything is so much more interesting with music.
 So I always use it.
 It's not bad, it's not too sweet.
 - So there's an iconic Instagram photo that you have.
 You're holding a stack of tacos, and it's captioned,
 "The passion that never left me."
 As someone who's lived and traveled the world,
 is there a place outside of Mexico
 that you think does tacos best?
 - You know, I live in London now.
 There is a place I go with my daughter, Valentina,
 who loves it, and it's just called Taqueria.
 I mean, not very original, the name, but we love it.
 They make good tacos, and I have a place
 called Mestizo in London.
 They sell the tacos too, but you can buy
 all the Mexican ingredients, everything that you need,
 you can buy there to make the food at home.
 So the best tacos, outside of Mexico,
 any one of my houses.
 I like it, but maybe a little bit too salty.
 - Well, if Sama says it, then it's the truth.
 So, what do you remember about the mechanics
 of shooting that trolley car crash scene in Frida?
 For my money, one of the best movie scenes.
 - Oh, that's a good one.
 It was very complicated.
 It's actually one of the few times that
 there was a lot of dialogue about it,
 and should we try this, should we try that,
 because Julie Thimer is amazing,
 she knows exactly what she wants.
 She's very technical, she's very visual, she's very good.
 I love it because she said she painted her reality,
 but her reality was so poetic in so many ways,
 'cause that's the way she chose to see it.
 And I think this is the perfect scene
 that says a lot about her spirit,
 and the way she saw things,
 where it's one of the most tragic moments of her life,
 and yet it was so beautiful.
 And it did happen that there was a painter in the trolley
 that had gold powder, and so there was the blood,
 there was the blood, but there was the gold,
 and then it's just that there was something magical
 about this really painful moment in her life
 that marked her forever.
 - And then in 2014, you produced an animated film,
 "The Prophet," based on Khalil Gibran's classic book.
 - Yes, yes.
 - What's special about that project
 that makes it one of the few movies that you've done
 that you'd like to rewatch?
 - Oh my God.
 I had a sentimental attachment to the book
 because of my grandfather, who was Lebanese,
 and who kept the book by his bed.
 As I grew older, I read that book.
 Many different times.
 And I keep seeing it in a different way,
 and in a way, every time I find something new
 to learn from it, I feel it's like my grandfather,
 that even though he's not here with me,
 he's still teaching me about life
 through this amazing poet.
 Los Calientes, the hot ones, very appropriate for the show.
 Hmm.
 Hmm.
 Hmm.
 - Is that a good, is that a good hmm?
 - Oh yeah.
 I like Los Calientes.
 - We'll take that.
 So in addition to your more than 80 acting credits,
 you've also left your mark behind the camera,
 founding your production company, Ventana Rosa, in 1999.
 And I've heard you say some incisive things
 about the discouraging and heartbreaking process
 of shopping scripts.
 When you hear about a script that's locked away
 in a drawer in a production studio somewhere,
 how did it get there,
 and what's keeping that movie from getting made?
 - A lot of times it's money.
 You have a great concept that everybody likes,
 but you have to have writers writing it.
 And sometimes it's, the writers are not doing exactly
 what the director or the studio was hoping for,
 but you have to pay them.
 So here comes another writer.
 And sometimes you have to buy the buy of the,
 writes of the book, and then you don't have them
 after a certain time, so you have to pay again.
 And a lot of the times you just get like a big bill,
 and the movie has not started.
 And it just becomes really hard to make it.
 And it's sad because things are changing now.
 But in the past, if you had a script that was a great script
 about a minority, it wouldn't get made
 because there was not enough minorities
 that could open a film according to the studios.
 Not being of the name.
 And if the script is expensive,
 you have to have one of the A-lees,
 which is a very limited number of actors,
 and usually they're not minorities.
 So things are beginning to change,
 but there were a lot of great stories
 that because they were not easy to cast,
 just because the big stars
 were not of that type of diversity, died.
 Hopefully they'll come back now.
 (gentle music)
 - It's spicy.
 - Yeah, a little bit of a step up.
 - Like four steps up.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah.
 - But it's good.
 But you know what, I'm impressed.
 - I'll take that, I'll take that.
 - Your eyes are watering.
 - A little bit, right.
 - That's your tell.
 - Oh, I like this.
 - But you're not pink on the face yet.
 - Not yet, not yet, it'll get there, I think.
 - I'm hoping.
 'Cause you know what, I had a theory.
 I was wondering if you give me this
 and then you just have a little bit of barbecue sauce.
 - Right, right, you know.
 - In all of you, so I was gonna say,
 well, let's exchange the wing.
 Maybe we do that for the next one.
 - All right, fine, I'm down with that.
 I am A-okay with that.
 You wanna switch? - I'm like, I'm suspicious.
 - Sure, sure, I'm totally fine with you kicking the tires.
 - No, but I see your eyes, I see your eyes.
 - I am a chicken wing talk show host of Dignity.
 - You are, you actually are, yeah.
 - All right, Salma, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 and we'll put up a couple interesting pictures
 that need more context.
 So we'll put the picture up on the monitor,
 and given your love of animals,
 it's an all wildlife theme for Salma Hayek.
 Do you have any truffle hunting 101 tips
 that you picked up on this afternoon
 that you spent with Zara and Mala?
 - I'll tell you a funny story about it.
 So we went to look for the truffles,
 and the guide was a fan.
 And he said to me, look, I love you too much,
 I cannot lie to you, okay?
 And I said, please, we don't know
 if we're gonna find truffles or not,
 and we don't wanna disappoint the tourists.
 So we hide them sometimes.
 (laughing)
 But I was in love with the dogs,
 but what we're gonna do now,
 we're gonna do it differently.
 One of you goes and hides them,
 and we're gonna wait here,
 and then I'm gonna show you how the dogs find it.
 But my girls were naughty.
 I mean, they hid those things on the trees, under the water.
 I mean, they really were so mean to the dogs,
 and we couldn't find them forever,
 but the dogs found them.
 They finally found them.
 I love truffles, I have to admit.
 - They're the best.
 All right, one more for you.
 You're the first person I've ever interviewed
 with an owl as a pet.
 Can you give me a pro and a con of having an owl as a pet?
 - If it's a hot night, you can sleep with it,
 and they're like flying all night, you know?
 And you can feel the air as they fly by.
 She's just lovely, funny, temperamental.
 You know, she can be moody, and I love that about her too.
 Her eyes are hypnotic, and they really calm me down.
 What I don't like, they have to eat the rats.
 That's what I feed them.
 And a couple of times, she's landed on my head with a rat,
 and that just, it's not a good sensation.
 That's just not cool.
 Lechuga, that's lettuce.
 - Mr. Lettuce.
 - Oh, I like this one.
 It has a little bit of cinnamon in it.
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.
 - Can you taste it?
 - Mm-hmm, good palate.
 - Yeah, this is different.
 It's very nice, this sauce.
 It's hot, but it's very nice.
 I'm into it.
 - So there's a quote of yours
 that I thought was really interesting,
 where you said, "Producing is hell, writing is frustrating,
 "acting is really satisfying, directing is heaven.
 "And in journalism, writers will oftentimes become editors
 "because it's a clearer career path
 "to more stability and money.
 "But that's not necessarily the case
 "for A-list actors becoming directors."
 How do you explain the draw?
 - I think for me, what my draw would be
 is that sometimes I have a story to tell,
 and I don't want the limitation of my body
 and who I am to just tell one character
 of someone else's story,
 but to tell the perspective of a story
 that you have a special perspective on something.
 Like if your brain is wired in a way
 that the way you can tell it is not so much with words,
 but with moods and the little moments, the details,
 you wanna feel it, you wanna feel the light,
 you wanna be able to put the music into it
 and work with the actors.
 And maybe you are wired in that way
 or have that desire to direct
 because I can see you pay a lot of attention to detail.
 - Thank you.
 - But you would have wanted to do it
 even if you had done a different career.
 I think it's a way of being wiring,
 having that perspective and an interesting visual way
 to do it.
 For example, I'm very highly dyslexic,
 so my brain, instead of reading words, just sees images.
 And that's like a good thing if you wanted to be a director.
 Poodle of fire.
 Okay, whatever that means.
 Mm, this one has habanero.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Mm, I love habanero.
 Mm.
 - Bigger kick though, but you're doing good.
 - I like this one.
 - Wow.
 - This one would taste good.
 Do you mind if I put some lemon in it?
 - Go ahead, go for it.
 That's why it's there.
 - A little salty too.
 - There we go.
 - Mm, I like this one a lot.
 - I like this.
 - You have to remember that in Mexico,
 you grow up with candy,
 like when you were a kid.
 Mm, must be like as hot as number three.
 It's sweet, but it's full of chili.
 There's a lot of spicy candy that children do eat
 so you get used to it.
 - There we go.
 - I like it.
 - Learning all sorts of things today.
 One of your passions that I know that you pursue
 in your downtime is diving,
 which you've been doing since you were 10 years old.
 - Love diving.
 - Besides that time that you had to be transported
 to a decompression chamber for eight hours
 after an especially deep voyage.
 (laughs)
 - Have you ever had a harrowing encounter
 with a sea creature or anything?
 - I've had so many encounters with sea creatures
 and they come, I have a good vibe.
 I have a good--
 - Good vibe?
 - Yeah.
 I had an octopus one time explore me.
 Was very interesting.
 I stay very still, but it goes dark.
 But at the beginning, there was some light going in there.
 And just to see the tentacles attached to the thing,
 you have to hold on to the respirator
 because they can pull it out.
 And he was moving the mask and going around.
 I stay very calm, very still.
 And he explore me and left.
 I was strange.
 Just 'cause the texture and everything about them
 is so interesting.
 - Here's me breaking down the fourth wall here
 and just being your friend.
 You're crushing it, you're doing great.
 - But this is gonna kill me, right?
 - Right.
 (laughs)
 (dramatic music)
 - As long as it doesn't give me diarrhea.
 - No promises.
 - I have a movie to promote.
 (laughs)
 If it does, I'm gonna send you to the Mexican mafia.
 - Okay, all right, all right.
 Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
 - I shouldn't have said that, bro.
 (dramatic music)
 - This is very hot.
 I'm not good.
 Oh my God.
 I am playing an eternal, but my tongue is still human.
 (laughs)
 - What do you remember about eating--
 - It's a tricky bastard because like even at the beginning
 it's not as hot and as time goes by--
 - It grows and it grows and it grows on you.
 Yeah, and it doesn't seem to stop or slow down.
 What do you remember about eating the heart of a sea dragon
 in your film "Tale of Tales"?
 And was it more or less disgusting
 than the wing we just ate?
 (crunching)
 - It didn't hurt that one.
 It was disgusting.
 Oh, my tongue is hurting.
 (laughs)
 Too much pain for very little pleasure.
 (laughs)
 Oh my God.
 - That should be the tagline.
 - I'm going back to the ones at the beginning.
 - Yeah, to cleanse the palate a little bit.
 - I'm taking my Doritos with--
 (crunching)
 Oh!
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 (laughs)
 No!
 It's terrible.
 I'm not answering any more questions to you.
 (laughs)
 My tongue hurts.
 - We'll slow it down, we'll slow it down.
 My question was,
 it's a disgusting question.
 - Sure, but it's an open form.
 - But if you're really, really hot with something,
 have you ever had somebody who,
 their nose started to run in the middle of the show?
 - Yeah, yeah, I've seen runny noses and--
 - I was afraid of it, but I think I'm doing okay.
 - You're doing great, you're doing great.
 I've seen it all over here.
 I've seen it all from this side of the table.
 (crunching)
 Oh!
 - Oh, God.
 (crunching)
 No me gustas.
 (laughs)
 - What makes the small Japanese restaurant,
 Oya in Boston, one of the most inspiring places
 that you've ever eaten?
 - Creativity.
 - There we go.
 (crunching)
 - They are so original.
 The taste is just so good and the fish is so good.
 But they have some really special dishes that I love.
 Oh my God, it's still burning.
 (laughs)
 - Do you wanna slow it down?
 Do you wanna move on to the next one?
 - I want this taste to get out of my mouth.
 - Right, right, right.
 (crunching)
 - I'm about to start crying.
 (laughs)
 Let's take, this is gonna be even hotter.
 - I guess there's only one way to find out.
 There's only one way to find out.
 (dramatic music)
 - It's very, very hot.
 At least it tastes good.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - The other one is just like an attack to the tongue,
 you know, and you don't even get to feel any flavor.
 Just pain.
 (laughs)
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Like a bad lover.
 (laughs)
 - It's the first time I've heard this sauce.
 I've heard this sauce described so many ways.
 First time I've ever heard it described that way.
 (laughs)
 - I'm accurate, but I like the other one.
 The other one is hot.
 But it's a different kind of hot.
 It's not like, I'm gonna make a sauce
 that people wanna make some jokes to their friends.
 - Right, right. - You know?
 - Prank sauce.
 - Prank sauce, or to attack, or just to say,
 oh, I am macho, macho, I can eat this sauce.
 No, this one is like.
 And the one I just tried, it's called what?
 - Da Bomb.
 - This one is like, your tongue is about to melt.
 - Right, yeah.
 - And that's not a good thing.
 - Oh, okay.
 - So earlier this year, you starred in "Bliss,"
 which is a sci-fi movie that wrestles
 with the idea of artificially simulated worlds.
 And then one of Frida Kahlo's most famous paintings,
 the two Fridas, has some parallel universe qualities to it.
 Do you think Frida would have embraced a connection
 between art and string theory?
 - She would have loved it.
 It's part of what you can see it in her art.
 It's a very interesting question.
 She was able to paint in one painting
 many aspects of her reality
 that maybe for nobody else saw the reality like that.
 But she felt it very real.
 So I think she would have been fascinated
 with string theory and different dimensions,
 different possibilities of existing at the same time.
 And that's the worst one.
 (laughs)
 - It's an insult to the tongue.
 The way you do it is you don't wanna dab it on the wing.
 - Right. - You dab it next to it.
 - Yeah, you'd think at this point,
 I'd figure that out. - And then.
 - But a million times,
 I've just dumped this sauce all over the wing.
 But you're right, that's the smart way to do it.
 (gentle music)
 'Cause you never know what it's gonna be like.
 Especially when they're thick.
 Sometimes too much just comes out.
 - That's someone who's been around hot sauce a lot before.
 All right, Salma Hayek, at long last we've conquered.
 - I'm finishing this one.
 - Now I'm going back in too.
 - You know what?
 I am adopting you.
 - Whoa.
 - As a Mexican.
 Even if you're not,
 (laughs)
 you are an honorary Mexican from today on.
 You can really handle your chilies.
 - Such a compliment coming from you, Salma Hayek.
 And you know what?
 At long last we've conquered the wings of death
 and just one more annoyingly drawn out question
 before we roll credits.
 You know, your origin story
 of leaving soap operas in Mexico to take a chance
 in Hollywood, it's well known.
 But one thing that I found interesting
 was a revelation that you had when you said,
 "My passion was not acting, it was movies."
 Can you unpackage what you meant by that
 while your brain and tongue slow roast in hot sauce?
 (laughs)
 - Because, you know, if you ask me,
 who did you wanna be like?
 Like what was your favorite actor
 that you wanted to be like?
 But who was your icon?
 I didn't have one.
 I just want to be part of the films.
 I just want to be in the films.
 And when they asked me,
 what was the movie that make you wanna be an actress?
 I would say, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"
 because when I was a little girl, I was watching it
 and I thought it was amazing.
 I said, "Wait a minute, wow.
 "There is a universe where everything is possible.
 "And you can live in another era in the past
 "or in the future.
 "And you know, you can have a river made out of chocolate.
 "Everything is possible."
 And that's films.
 Everything is possible.
 Talking about the realities and spring theory,
 back to that.
 And so I just want to be a part of that.
 And it's been so much fun.
 - Beautifully said,
 glamorously crushing the wings of death today.
 And look at you, Salma Hayek,
 coming into "Hot Ones,"
 taking down the wings of death,
 living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you, Salma Hayek.
 - I wish my husband was here so I could kiss him.
 (laughs)
 And then he'll be on fire with me.
 He'll be on fire, I wouldn't even know why.
 - But in the meantime, Salma Hayek,
 this camera, this camera, or this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - I have a movie coming out called "Eternals"
 with a bunch of amazing people
 and the best director in the world.
 I'm very proud to be part of this project.
 You have to come and see it.
 And then I have a small part, but really fun,
 in another movie that I own this year with Lady Gaga
 called "House of Gucci."
 So I was gonna be a good Ridley Scott director,
 so very, very excited I got to work
 with such good directors.
 Come and check them out.
 (applause)
 Thank you.
 Wow.
 - You did it.
 Great job.
 - I had a lovely time.
 But also, your questions were very smart.
 - Oh, thank you, I appreciate that.
 How many do you do?
 - Believe it or not, I think I've done this like 230 times.
 This is the, you're in the 16th season.
 - But you do it once a week?
 - Yeah, so we do like 36 episodes a year.
 So like 12 episode seasons take a little time off.
 - No, because the amount of research is a lot of work.
 - Yeah, yeah, but you know what?
 I love it.
 I love doing that.
 I love watching your movies
 and kind of like diving into your life
 and walking a mile in your shoes.
 - No, you can't tell that you like movies a lot.
 - But sometimes it's not just movies that you have to.
 - Yeah, but I like the variation though.
 Like I kind of like walking a mile
 in somebody else's shoes,
 kind of like seeing what it's like,
 experiencing their art, listening to their music,
 reading their books, watching their movies, whatever.
 And then sitting down with them
 and then just seeing if you can execute against that.
 But that's my favorite part of my job.
 - And who's the worst one you've ever interviewed?
 (laughing)
 After the comment as well.
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans checking in
 with a very exciting announcement.
 Hungry for more, a brand new documentary series
 from First We Feast is now live on the channel.
 You know, this black box,
 it's great for grilling celebrities
 over scorching hot chicken wings from week to week,
 but outside of these walls is a whole new vanguard
 of chefs, restaurant tours,
 and do-it-yourself food hustlers
 who are taking comfort food to their communities and beyond.
 From a mom and pop taco shop
 that my boy JJ Redick calls the best in the country
 to a Bronx native taking the iconic
 New York chop cheese sandwich to the streets.
 Without further ado, you know the drill.
 Colin, roll the tape.
 - When I had my first chop cheese,
 I thought this is amazing.
 - It's a sandwich that you gotta be from New York
 to be familiar with.
 - We chose to go the plant-based route.
 - When we were gonna open this place,
 no one understood what we were trying to build.
 - My identity has always been a rule follower,
 and now with Eat It, I feel like we're breaking every rule.
 If we're gonna make it, like, we have to be adaptable.
 - Food for me has always been sort of like a pursuit,
 an outlet.
 As a young player, my way to explore a city
 was to explore the restaurant.
 - You wanna make it in the world,
 you gotta start from your corner.
 - I'm just happy to showcase my food to more people,
 you know?
 - Identify all the beauty that's within the neighborhood
 and bring it out to the world.
