 (dramatic music)
 - Oh yeah, now it's show.
 (laughing)
 Now I get it.
 Ow!
 (gentle music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by John Stamos.
 - I have to say, you're more handsome in person.
 - Oh my gosh, I will take that.
 - I'm not kidding.
 - That is such a compliment coming from you.
 - I didn't know what to expect when I walked in here,
 but I saw you on TV, but you're just tall.
 - Thank you so much, wow.
 All right, let me get to you, John.
 He's an actor, producer, and pop culture icon
 you know from shows like Full House, General Hospital,
 ER, and many more.
 And he also has a brand new memoir on the way
 doing a funny, brutally honest autopsy
 on his 40 years in Hollywood.
 It's called If You Would Have Told Me
 and it's due out this October.
 John Stamos, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you.
 If you would have told me
 that I would be eating hot wings with you today.
 - Who would have believed it?
 - Who would have believed it?
 Who would think that a show like this would be so popular?
 - I'm just as shocked as you.
 - I love watching it.
 I love Grohl was great on here.
 - Oh, thank you.
 - And I know you had my friend Bob on,
 which was really beautiful.
 - Love that episode.
 - I'm fascinated by this and by you.
 Were you an interviewer or something before?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - 'Cause you're so smart, man.
 And you rattle off these questions.
 I got some notes, but.
 - We'll see today, we'll see today.
 Maybe I'll blow the whole mystique for you.
 - I don't think so.
 - Only time will tell.
 You ready to get started?
 - I guess.
 (upbeat music)
 - Oh, the handle, okay.
 There you go.
 Oh, it's so.
 Why?
 It's not very ladylike to me.
 - Oh no, I get it, I get it.
 - But I'm not.
 - Great.
 - Your memoir, if you would have told me,
 is chock full of encounters with some of the true
 old legend titans of Hollywood.
 And that's a lot of celebrity memoirs,
 but I think the difference with you
 is that you'll maintain a relationship
 with Sammy Davis Jr.
 You'll become friends with Don Rickles.
 Do you have any tips for fostering mentors or older friends?
 Like, it just seems like a good life skill to have
 for anyone who's just trying to mainline
 a little wit and wisdom.
 - It's, I recommend it.
 Find some old, you know, crusty guy
 that will tell you the truth.
 Sadly, I've lost a lot of my good ones, you know.
 But I just paid attention to him.
 Like, Rickles, he became like a second father to me.
 He lost his son, which was really sad.
 And, but I always wanted the, it's kind of a weird thing,
 'cause like, I wanted the best for him all the time.
 I got, I was on ER at the time, and he was watching it.
 He said, "How do you learn all those lines?"
 I said, "Well, you just learn 'em."
 And I went to the producer and said,
 "Let's get Rickles on here, it'd be great, you know."
 Okay, and they wrote him this big, beautiful part.
 I know he would've won an award for it.
 And he, the night before he's supposed to start,
 he, the publicist calls, "Oh, Don's not doing it."
 "What do you mean Don's not doing it?
 "He starts tomorrow."
 He backed out and I looked like an idiot, you know.
 And he called, he didn't talk to me for like a couple weeks.
 I was waiting for an apology,
 and we talked for a little while, talked.
 We used to talk like schoolgirls.
 We'd talk for an hour on the phone.
 And finally, at the end, he said,
 "Hey, I'm sorry I didn't do that show."
 I said, "Okay, Don, you can't argue with him."
 He goes, "John, I couldn't remember those lines,
 "and I didn't want to embarrass you."
 I said, "It's okay, Don, I love you."
 He used to say, "Keep my name alive, I'll keep my name alive."
 So here we're keeping his name alive.
 (laughs)
 What's the weirdest thing that's happened on the show?
 - Oh, so many weird things.
 Like Aubrey Plaza snorted milk, I remember one time.
 Gordon Ramsay had like a milk fire extinguisher
 that he blasted at me from across the table.
 He had like a whole Mary Poppins bag of antidotes.
 Me and Dave Grohl actually--
 - I thought, you got drunk and everything?
 - Yeah, we did shot for shot, wing for wing,
 ended up cleaning out an entire bottle of Crown Royal.
 And that was like a 10 a.m. shoot, by the way.
 Just stumbling out of this studio.
 - Man, I wanna drink with a rock star, you know.
 - Crazy things have happened.
 So no matter what you're going through on the show,
 just know that way weirder shit is happening.
 - I'm an erect, I'm erect right now.
 (laughs)
 How's that happen?
 - So as a comedy nerd, I've heard you talk about
 how much you learned on the Full House set
 working with comics like Bob and Dave.
 Do you have a sense of what makes a show like Full House
 work on a foundational level or the non-negotiables
 when it comes to crafting a sitcom that endures?
 - The Full House was, I hated that show.
 (laughs)
 - I've heard you talk about it.
 - And I, you know, I obviously ended up loving it.
 But it was sort of pitched to me as "Buzzin' Buddies."
 It was Jeff Franklin who worked on "Buzzin' Buddies"
 and Miller and Boyette and "Buzzin' Buddies"
 with a couple of kids in the background.
 And as we're casting it, I was like,
 they're spending a lot of time casting these kids
 that are gonna be in the background.
 (laughs)
 We did a table read of it and I was the star.
 I was coming off of General Hospital
 and all the mothers were, "Hey, how you doing?"
 Big shot, like that thing.
 And we sit down and we start reading
 and Jodie Sweetin, who plays Stephanie,
 starts reading the lines and people are dying laughing.
 I mean, screaming.
 I was like, what's happening here?
 Like what was, and I'm slowly,
 like she was getting confidence and like, boom, knock.
 You know, home run, home run.
 And I'm like, they couldn't even hear my lines.
 They were laughing so hard at her.
 And I'm like slinking down on my seat like this.
 And I run out to the, I never forget.
 I run out to the lobby.
 We're at the Century Plaza Hotel
 and I'm digging in my pocket for quarters.
 I'm like, "Jim, get me the fuck off this show."
 To my agent.
 (laughs)
 And then we was like, "Oh, let's give it a try."
 And then Bob came in and I fought it for a long time.
 And then I finally said, "What am I doing?
 It's a beautiful show."
 We built with sweetness and kindness.
 The show, there was no central character on that show
 is what I realized.
 The central character was love.
 And that's, we were the best representation
 of a loving family, not a normal family.
 And it was the new normal was now an unconventional family.
 So I guess that was it.
 I don't know.
 "Crabby's Shack" here.
 - Yep.
 - Hi, I'm Sean.
 (laughs)
 I have a wig on tonight and I'm posting.
 Lemon pepper sauce, sweet sauce, hot sauce.
 You don't even know what you're eating anymore.
 - I don't, I have no idea.
 - Have you noticed I've only taken a slight bite
 out of each one?
 Anybody have a spit?
 You have a...
 - Well, there's a little can over there.
 - I won't do that.
 - But it's there in case you need to, all right?
 Never say never.
 So in 2010, you won a Golden Icon Award
 for your performance in the Broadway revival
 of "Bye Bye Birdie."
 - I did.
 - What did you find that you gained from the stage
 that you hadn't yet experienced on a TV set?
 - It was like nothing else.
 You can do television, you do movies, you do concerts.
 They all happen at different times.
 But in that eight block radius
 where all the theaters are at eight o'clock,
 like everybody's gearing up to be entertained at eight
 and all the entertainers are getting ready to entertain
 and it all happens right at eight o'clock.
 There's a spark that you can feel.
 Like never felt that before.
 I'm boring you.
 - No, I'm not.
 - This is one of the most boring...
 People out there are going, "Theater, what?"
 (laughs)
 These kids, they don't know theater.
 But I did something with Nick Jonas.
 - No, well you did a Gore Vidal play with legends.
 You were the Angela Lansbury and James Earl Jones.
 - James Earl Jones, that was good.
 Hands down the greatest living actor of my generation.
 And it was the last night and I said,
 James, you really gave me legitimacy working with you
 and being in the show.
 It's really taken me away from this mullet-headed thing
 that I used to do and I'm proud of you.
 So we go out, just as I'm finishing it,
 the stage door opens and people are out there
 for autographs screaming, "Uncle Jesse, Uncle Jesse!"
 Say, "Have mercy!"
 And I couldn't even look at him.
 I was so embarrassed.
 I was like, "Okay."
 And as I look over and then I hear him, I think,
 they go, "James, say, 'Luke, I am your father.'
 "Luke, I'm..."
 Same thing.
 And I look at him and we just start laughing
 and it was a beautiful moment,
 which kind of goes back to the philosophy.
 It's like, you can't fight it.
 But did I answer your question?
 (upbeat music)
 Fuego, that means hot.
 I remember...
 I used to work at my dad's...
 Did anybody just pass out?
 They're a bit funny.
 It's no problem, I got far.
 I should do that.
 Pretend I didn't say that.
 I used to work at my dad's restaurant in Orange County.
 We had these little green peppers,
 like these little chili peppers.
 Big thing of them.
 And I'm eating those, "These are good, these are good."
 I'm putting my hands on it.
 And then one day I went to the restroom,
 put my hands out.
 (screams)
 (coughs)
 Oh no, so that last one just came back up.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And I haven't eaten hot stuff since he passed away.
 Where are your parents at?
 My mom's passed, but my dad's still around.
 Where, where?
 In Chicago, yeah.
 We play at Ravinia a lot.
 Do you ever go to that?
 Yeah, he loves Ravinia.
 He loves Ravinia.
 Oh yeah?
 Like, season pass.
 I think he was there like the other night.
 Tell him.
 Can we get him on the phone?
 (laughs)
 Maybe.
 Hold on, can somebody grab my phone?
 Is he funny?
 Well, I don't know.
 I don't know if he's camera ready.
 Is he sleeping?
 We'll give it a shot.
 Hold on, let's put this on speaker.
 (phone ringing)
 Chicago, huh?
 Uh-huh.
 Hey son.
 (laughs)
 Come on.
 Hey there.
 Hey, dad.
 Hi, dad.
 I'm happy you picked up.
 Hey.
 Hey, um.
 What are you wearing?
 I'm on the phone with John Stamos.
 You're actually on the show right now, okay?
 I'm gonna put you on the phone with John Stamos.
 Mike.
 Oh, hi Mr. Evans, it's John Stamos.
 Hi, John.
 (laughs)
 Meanwhile, he's going, "Who the fuck is this?
 Who's John Stamos?"
 I was just talking about, I'm on your show,
 the Your Son Show.
 Are you proud of him?
 Absolutely.
 Yeah, it's quite a show.
 We, I play with the Beach Boys, you know,
 and we're at Ravinia every other year.
 Have you seen them?
 I've heard you play drums
 with the Beach Boys at Ravinia.
 He does know who I am.
 Oh yeah?
 Thank you.
 We did, so, oh, your son said you had season tickets
 and stuff.
 Not season tickets, but like seasons.
 We don't have season tickets,
 but we go several times a year.
 And I do remember you being there with the Beach Boys
 last time we were down there.
 So.
 Cool.
 The last time that we saw the Beach Boys.
 Anytime we're there, you have front row seats,
 backstage passes on me.
 I would love to meet you and see you after or before
 the show and maybe even get on stage
 and sing Bob Maran with us.
 (laughs)
 I'll take you up on that.
 (laughs)
 But thank you, sir.
 Very nice to meet you.
 I think we can destroy the history of the Beach Boys
 harmonies.
 It'll be wonderful.
 I've already done that, so.
 (laughs)
 Hey, nice to talk to you.
 And I'll see you at the next Ravinia show maybe, huh?
 Yeah, sounds good.
 Okay.
 Thank you, buddy.
 Yeah, take care.
 Your son's making a lot of money by the way, so.
 (laughs)
 Somebody has to.
 (laughs)
 All right, love you.
 Love you.
 Love you too.
 All right, bye.
 That's great that you said I love you.
 That's so beautiful.
 (upbeat music)
 Whoa.
 That's good.
 I still love wings.
 I just don't eat them that much anymore because, you know.
 (laughs)
 Television.
 (laughs)
 I get it, I get it.
 You know, it's a cross-eyed bear over here.
 I was fascinated by your Grand Scheme podcast
 where you talked about the kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr.
 A story that somehow flew under my radar
 even as a true crime obsessive.
 This story is really like a Martin McDonough film.
 You know, like there are so many absurd twists and turns.
 A part for me that made me laugh was it's like,
 you know, Frank Sinatra says, you know,
 "I'll give you a million dollars."
 Yeah, right, right, right.
 "Give me back my son."
 And they're like, "Oh, a million dollars?
 "We don't need a million dollars.
 "We just want like 240,000."
 Yeah, it was part of the script.
 (laughs)
 It was part of the script and the dummy
 who was talking to Sinatra, you know,
 he said, "How much do you want?"
 And the guy says, "260."
 And the FBI was on the phone,
 "It's $260 million, what the fuck are we?"
 You know, all it had was a million.
 No, it's just 260, $260,000.
 They're like, "What?"
 (laughs)
 Yeah, it was crazy.
 It was, you know, and I sold it as a,
 I brought him into Netflix.
 We sold it on, you know, right away.
 But this dummy wanted a million dollars per episode.
 No, it's not, get out of here.
 And then I let it go for a while.
 And then I couldn't let it go.
 So I did this podcast, that podcast.
 But I'm glad you knew about it, but yeah.
 (gentle music)
 You should do this in a pool.
 For the season, what season, 21?
 - 21, yeah.
 - Let's add an element.
 Strip club.
 - Ooh.
 - Trying to get your leg.
 (laughs)
 - Thanks, I need all the help I can get over here.
 - Me and Zagat and Couier went to a strip club early on.
 The show got picked up for another season or something.
 We were in Culver City working Culver City.
 Let's go to a strip club.
 And Bob was always very like, "I'm too famous."
 (laughs)
 It's all right.
 You know, put a hat on or something.
 I don't worry, I know the guy's there.
 I'll take care of this.
 Bob's got a hat and thing and all.
 And we get there, okay, good, just call it back, okay?
 Thank you, boy.
 And coming here live, look at this,
 the boys from Full House.
 It's Uncle Jesse, Joey and Danny.
 Give them a big round of applause.
 Bob's like, "Oh."
 (laughs)
 Hot Ones live at the Rhino.
 - At the Rhino, at the Spearman Rhino.
 - How'd you know?
 - I don't know.
 I just, I guessed.
 (laughs)
 - So you live in New York?
 Why did you go to New York to be a journalist?
 - Yeah.
 - And who's your favorite, Howard?
 Who were the old guys?
 - The most formative people.
 Letterman, Howard, and then I used to listen
 to Loveline every night, Adam Carolla.
 - Jimmy was Jimmy?
 - Jimmy was, that was probably like
 my Mount Rushmore growing up.
 Like I was like a weird kid.
 Like I'd put like Howard on like tape or like whatever
 and like bring it to school and like listen to it at recess
 and shit like that.
 - Really?
 - It was fucking weird.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Or like my dad, yeah, my dad was like a huge Letterman fan
 and then he would tape like all the episodes for the week
 and then he'd binge them on the weekend
 and I'd like watch them with him
 and have him explain the jokes
 like my mom's explaining songs.
 Like that was the whole thing.
 - That's so cool.
 - So yeah.
 - Do you remember the scene in Howard's movie,
 Private Parts?
 I felt like, did you talk about it in an interview
 where you said when he came down as Fart Man
 and the whole thing?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Oh, wow.
 - Yeah, what was it?
 'Cause I didn't get the analogy.
 - So what I was saying is like when we did this show
 early on, like, you know, it was more like
 why did my publicist put me on this freak show
 when they walk into the room, right?
 So that's how I was like making the comparison to Fart Man.
 Fart Man comes down, the whole crowd is going nuts.
 He blows up the podium with a giant fart.
 Everyone's going crazy and then he walks backstage
 and everyone's disgusted with him.
 You know what I mean?
 So that's what I was kind of like.
 - Right, right.
 - So that's how he was on the radio.
 People shit on him, they thought,
 he's a dirty asshole, you know,
 and then all of a sudden he did.
 But here's my question for you.
 Who, in that scene, he comes down,
 and it's MTV, right?
 - It's MTV Movie Awards.
 - And what's his name?
 Who introduces him?
 It was--
 - Oh, good question.
 - Like he goes, "Hey, ladies and gentlemen."
 Oh yeah, it was me.
 Good research, you asshole.
 (laughing)
 God, who was it, who was it?
 You know, oh, I spend the whole week researching
 every person that comes in.
 - Oh, I didn't watch Private Parts.
 I didn't watch Private Parts.
 - What do you mean you didn't watch it?
 You just talked about it.
 - Not this week.
 Sorry, I watched it, not this week, dude.
 - Yeah, but you know the thing well enough
 to be quoting it and comparing it to you.
 - I'll tell you what I did watch.
 - Go ahead.
 - Never Too Young to Die.
 - We gotta talk about that.
 - All right, fine, let's talk about that.
 - But the story on that was that Luke Perry,
 did anybody throw that at you in one of these shows?
 Luke Perry was the guy who did it on MTV for Howard.
 And Luke Perry was like, I'm too big to work with you, Howard,
 on this shitty movie that you're doing.
 So he calls me at the last minute,
 hey, Stamos, could you do me a favor?
 Like, he bailed, could you do it?
 I'm like, yeah, fuck yeah.
 I flew out there, me and Slash were there all day
 drinking beer and it was great.
 - That's amazing.
 - But you didn't, I wasn't that, I guess.
 - You schmuck baited me.
 - But you didn't know that, I mean, you would have said,
 you know the scene, John, you were in it.
 - Yeah, I'm picturing the scene, I already know.
 It's like a low camera shot.
 It's like to the ceiling, the blue on the stage.
 - Somebody introduces him, like, yeah.
 - Who was it, who was it, who was it?
 Was it Rob Lowe?
 (laughing)
 - Funny.
 So all the comedians that bet on you
 have rubbed off on you, you know?
 (laughing)
 That was good, Rob, okay.
 Do you ever have co-hosts on this thing?
 - No, why, are you auditioning?
 - Yeah.
 - This is like, wow, are you for real?
 - I'm fine.
 (laughing)
 That was a joke.
 I do my own stunts.
 It's not that bad.
 - You're taking it better than I am.
 This one's never easy for me.
 Look at you.
 I'm humbled on this side of the table.
 You're nailing this co-host audition.
 - You think?
 - Yeah.
 - It gets hotter.
 - Yeah. - It's sneaking up.
 (dramatic music)
 - Yeah, I know, I know.
 - Oh yeah, now it's show.
 (laughing)
 Now I get it.
 - Ow!
 - I know. - Let's do anything?
 - I've never seen anyone try that move.
 It's fine, no.
 - No.
 (laughing)
 (groaning)
 - I know, I know, never easy, never easy.
 - That's eight?
 - That's eight, that's eight.
 So I understand that you once outbid Michael Jackson
 for one of the original Disneyland signs.
 - I can't hear, there's steam coming out of my ears.
 - Of all the Disney memorabilia and ephemera
 that you've collected over the years,
 is there one that you would call your holy grail?
 - That's what I get.
 - You guys set me up, didn't you?
 - Schmuck baited you.
 - All these were just normal ones from Lots Berry Farm, man.
 - Ah, I know, I know.
 - Disney was, they had a warehouse full of stuff.
 The first thing on the auction was a big,
 gigantic sign outside of Harbor Boulevard.
 Michael Jackson wanted it,
 it was gonna go for a million dollars,
 and I forgot about it, and then I was in my office,
 and I put it on, and I was like,
 oh shit, I'm winning this thing.
 There was like an hour left, refresh, refresh, refresh.
 Called my business, I said,
 I think I'm gonna win this sign, 32 grand.
 I was like, okay, how big is it?
 14 by eight, no, 14 inches by, 14 feet by,
 each letter is 14, it just gets hotter as you're talking.
 - Yeah, I know, I know.
 - 14 feet by eight feet, so they had to helicopter it in.
 - Oh.
 - This is what killed Sagittarius.
 He would do that joke if he was alive, to me.
 He wouldn't have waited a year and a half either.
 - Keep it alive, keep the name alive.
 - He would say the worst things.
 Yeah, that was terrible.
 And what goes in, okay.
 - Here we go.
 - So it's hotter, but not as.
 - It's hot, but it's not like the last one.
 - Okay.
 - Not like the last one.
 Is it true that you watched "Bobby Knight"
 to study the best way to throw a chair
 when you took on the role of a temperamental basketball coach
 in the Disney+ show "Big Shot"?
 - You don't even have cue cards either.
 You know what I'm saying?
 I'm not being funny, like you're so good at this.
 Are you a sports guy?
 - I am a sports guy.
 No, you're not a sports guy.
 It's interesting then to me that you'd like,
 you know, you're spending time with Jerry West,
 you're studying the film on "Bobby Knight"
 and I'm curious as like a non-sports guy
 how you kind of like absorb that.
 - I had an easier time with the medical jargon on ER
 than sports stuff on "Big Shot."
 So I mean, I just did my research, I studied
 and yeah, a friend of mine knew Jerry West,
 so I went to, you know, to meet him
 and I, hello, Mr. West, thanks for allowing me
 to come to this rehearsal today.
 First of all, it's not rehearsal, it's practice.
 - You called practice rehearsal?
 - Yeah, I'm an idiot.
 Well, those aren't costumes, they're uniforms.
 And he was funny and I did some jokes about him,
 you know, like on talk shows when I was trying to promote it
 and how dumb I was and he said, and then he went on something
 and said that boys, he was so convincing, he was so real,
 I was so proud of him, he really seemed like a real coach.
 Jerry West was managing the Clippers, right?
 And I thought they were a college team
 and that pissed him off.
 Like they're not, right?
 No, I thought they were pros.
 - They are pros, they are pros.
 - And I thought they were college
 because I played a college, you know, coach.
 I thought maybe, you know, oh, it's a college team.
 - All right, John.
 (liquid pouring)
 - Yeah.
 This is great fun, thanks for having me.
 All right, this is the last one.
 Do I get to, will you send anything home with me?
 - You get all the sauces, you get every, go ahead.
 Take a look around.
 - Okay.
 Have you ever got this in your eye or anything?
 - Yeah, every hot sauce mistake that you can make,
 I've made it.
 I've told that story about the green chilies and whatever.
 I've done that cross-pollination mistake.
 I've gotten sauce in my eyes.
 Everything, every possible hot sauce mistake you can make.
 - Cheers. - Cheers, John.
 - Mm.
 (John laughs)
 You ever people do that?
 - The wings of death, John, a distant memory, all right?
 You've taken on the hot ones gauntlet, lived to tell the tale
 and to close things out, what I wanna do
 is put you to the test a little bit.
 We have a couple pairs of drumsticks here.
 I'm curious if you can teach me some sort of drumstick trick, which might be a challenge
 with our fingers soaked in hot sauce over here.
 Okay.
 But let's give it a shot.
 Wow.
 I thought we were going to eat more wings.
 What do you want to learn?
 Whichever just…
 You want to try a paradiddle because it's a pretty a common…
 So it's right, left, right, right, left, right, left, left.
 Okay.
 Right, left, right, left.
 That's good.
 That's hard.
 There we go.
 I broke the table.
 You want to learn how to spin them?
 Here, put the stick…
 I put it like halfway through there.
 Now just kind of whip it around like…
 Oh, how'd you do that?
 Well, like this.
 Oh, wow.
 See?
 That's incredible.
 Yeah.
 Now I know why you didn't have a drumstick.
 I'm kidding.
 I'm kidding.
 I had to tell you.
 But if we…
 This will get you chicks.
 We should come over…
 I'll give you a good drum lesson.
 All right.
 Well, I'll take you up on that, John Stamos.
 And look at you taking on the wings of death, living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 Oh, I saw this bit.
 I have a book called If You Would Have Told Me.
 And that's it.
 But I'm going to tell…
 But what I have going on is this episode is going to be airing soon, and I'm going to have a whole party.
 That's why I want to take some of these when I leave.
 I want to have a party and everyone…
 I'll make everyone, you know, do a…
 Play along at home.
 Love that.
 Will you come over?
 I will definitely.
 I will be there.
 I will be there.
 Thank you, buddy.
 What a pleasure.
 You did so good.
 I did?
 Yeah.
 I did?
 You're a fucking man.
 He just said they're never going to air it.
 He whispered it in my ear.
 This is so great.
 Did I get the job?
 You're hired.
 You have beautiful eyes.
 Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?

 And if you've ever watched Hot Ones and wondered to yourself, how hot are those sauces really?
 I can get through that with no water or milk.
 Well, now is the time to put your money where your mouth is.
 The Hot Ones Season 21 lineup is now available in its entirety at Heatness.com.
 Heatness.com.
 That's Heatness.com to get your hands on the Season 21 Hot Ones Hot Sauce lineup.

 Be careful around the eyes and get them while they're hot.
