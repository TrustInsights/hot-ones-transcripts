 You with me, Tommy?
 I...
 That...
 is worse than I remember.

 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today, we welcome back our dear friend,
 Tom Segura. His latest special,
 Ball Hog, is available on Netflix now,
 and the man is a podcast factory.
 Your mom's house, Two Bears One Cave, and Tom Segura
 and Espanol, wherever you get your podcasts.
 This season, we're sprinkling in
 some of our favorite past guests,
 along with some new faces,
 and who better to welcome to the table
 than my brother Gavin's favorite
 all-time Hot Ones episode,
 my dear friend, Tom Segura.
 Tom, welcome back to Hot Ones.
 It's good to be back, Sean. Thank you for having me
 in this new normal.
 And it's good to be with you. Are you in New York?
 Are you on the East Coast? I'm in New York, yes.
 I can tell by the NYPD
 "Woo, woo!"
 as you were interviewing me.
 That's the sound of the police!
 Round two? Yeah, let's do it.
 Let's hit it.
 [crunching]
 Yeah.
 That's nice.
 So, this pandemic strikes me as a unique situation
 for comedians because on one hand,
 you have this universal, singular topic
 that everyone can relate to.
 But on the other hand, it's this totally
 miserable experience that everyone wants to escape.
 And there's been a lot of PR fallout
 from celebrity sing-alongs
 to famous people posting pictures
 by the pool saying, "I'm bored."
 Why are moments like these
 so difficult for celebrities to navigate?
 Because we have, for some reason,
 believed that if you're famous,
 you are intelligent
 or well-informed
 and know what to do.
 And then we go like, you know,
 "Hey, this actor really fucked up this moment."
 It's like, yeah, well, he's not a thinker.
 He's a fucking actor.
 We should stop being surprised
 that actors or singers
 are not navigating
 the waters perfectly
 because, you know, why would they?
 It's our own expectations.
 So we deserve to be disappointed by it.
 I heard you put forth an interesting theory
 on Two Bears One Cave where you suggested that
 despite being larger than life,
 Michael Jordan is a much more relatable celebrity
 than, say, John Travolta
 because of his line of work.
 When you're watching the interviews,
 specifically the interviews with him,
 and you're really thinking about the fact
 that this guy is as famous
 as anyone has probably ever been
 on Earth,
 and you see what that does,
 that type of fame,
 what it does to, let's say, entertainers, artists,
 right? Like singers, Madonna,
 actors, Travolta,
 Garth Brooks.
 These people get, like, really famous
 and they get, like,
 really famous and they get
 kind of fucking weird.
 And my theory is that it's all
 due to sports. It doesn't matter
 how you start in sports, it makes
 you kind of the same as the next
 man. So I think when you're around those
 kinds of people, it sort of brings you
 down. Whereas if you're an actor, you're a singer,
 you're around directors,
 PR people, red carpets. It's all about
 being like, "You're amazing, you're amazing, you're amazing."
 And I think that does something to their heads
 because those three people I listed at the beginning
 are fucking weird.
 I overdoused, but I'm doing it.
 It's for the people, man.
 Dude.
 See, that's nice.
 So "For the People" was actually a rather
 poetic segue into this next question
 because you have maybe the most dialed
 in fans I've ever seen.
 Underneath this video right now, I'm sure the comments
 are just filled with people telling us to keep
 our jeans high and tight and begging
 Garth Brooks to give the family closure.
 As someone who understands
 the art of humor, what is the value
 of an inside joke to you?
 I don't know. It's like, what's the value
 in a secret? It's almost like
 when you tell a secret to somebody,
 you reveal something
 and you guys have that bond.
 And with inside jokes, it's like
 you're just extending that bond.
 It becomes like a secret
 and you can't even do a handshake or a wink.
 When we did the drive-through
 inside joke, people would record
 themselves doing it and get elaborate.
 And the drive-through person is like,
 "Yeah, what can I do for you?" And he's like,
 "Hey, Gene, I was wondering if you could put
 a hot bag of poutine and
 Hitler would be wondering if you could give me
 some extra fries with that." And the person would be like,
 "Yeah, no problem." Like, they would never
 acknowledge that someone is saying
 insane shit to them.
 And that was definitely one of my favorites.
 [music]
 How's this one? Still pretty light?
 Let's see.
 Depending on the douse.
 There's a big douse in there.
 [music]
 That's what's up.
 So when our friend Burt Kreischer was on the show last,
 we drew back the curtain on your guys' legendary
 dance battle, one which Burt seems to freely
 admit that you won. But Burt did
 somewhat hurt that Post Malone didn't like his
 video. How big a deal was
 it for Missy Elliott to actually reach out
 to you?
 I mean, come on. Come on, dude.
 That was unbelievable. I mean,
 Missy Elliott, it's
 hard to describe
 what
 a genius this
 woman is, right?
 And she was a pioneer in the style
 of songs she was making. And of course,
 those of us that grew up with her know that
 she rewrote the books on
 music videos. Best videos.
 I mean, to another level.
 The only thing that bummed me out, she was like,
 "Who do y'all think won?" That was
 her tweet when she retweeted it. I was like,
 "The fuck are you talking about?"
 It was clear. It was me.
 And then also you dressed up as
 Sensei Steven Seagal. What is it
 about Steven Seagal that makes him such a
 prolific target in comedy?
 I mean, it's a number of things. Number one,
 he's the only person that
 in my limited experience
 in Hollywood that
 people are willing and freely
 to talk immense shit about.
 Like, people who never gossip
 are like, "That guy's a piece of garbage."
 And they'll tell you stories
 to back it up. Incredible stories.
 I also enjoy that he
 is on this plan right now to
 release like seven action
 films a year. He's like
 350 pounds. He's fighting people sitting
 down. And the premise
 of the films will be like, "We're in Afghanistan."
 And you're like, "That's Milwaukee." I can see
 that's where the fucking brewers play.
 Like, they don't even try to hide where they are.
 All that combined makes you go like,
 "Man, fuck this guy."
 Oh, fuck.
 God damn it.
 I've been dowsing, y'all. I've been dowsing.
 Look at that shit, man.
 Still enjoyable.
 We're still in that spot.
 So recently
 you made national headlines for comments
 you made about professional wrestling fans calling
 them idiots and grouping them alongside
 flat earthers and anti-vaxxers.
 How did the backlash
 this time around compare to some of your past
 controversies? I saw a handful of
 active wrestlers like threatened
 to beat your ass.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we'd have
 to script it out, but yeah, that would be fine.
 The funny thing about this was
 it was an off-the-cuff
 conversation on a podcast,
 but at the same time, I also like, you know, I don't care.
 I think it's cute that they play
 pretend. I think it's sweet that they
 have other friends to dress up with them.
 And, you know, I think the fans
 that, hey man, you like what you like, you know, some people
 like more sophisticated things.
 Some people like
 playing pretend. I think it's cute that
 those people do and I support them, you know.
 Comedian Matt McCarthy
 once compared wrestling to standup
 by saying that essentially both
 are about a man alone seeking justice
 presented in the most amusing
 way possible. Yes, and
 I do respect the fact that
 look, it is fun. Like I've already told you
 I love bits. I love silliness
 inside jokes
 and I love that they commit
 to these things and that they're
 out for their, you know,
 it is that form of entertainment.
 I do respect that they're athletes
 so people were like, oh, you're trying to say these aren't
 no, I think they're definitely athletes.
 They're not fighters.
 There's no such thing as a champion.
 That's my favorite thing about wrestling
 and they're like, this guy's an eight-time
 world champion. Like, oh, yeah, that's
 cute. Well, is the tooth fairy involved?
 I don't know what like you're not a champion
 if there's not a real competition,
 but that's never mind. I'm getting I'm getting
 sidetracked again. They're
 great.
 You ready to move on to five? I almost accidentally
 grabbed 10. Yeah.
 Here when they don't set your table for you.
 All right. How's this
 one? Oh,
 brah.
 That's a big douse.
 That's a big time house.
 All right.
 All right, Tom, as you know, we have a recurring
 segment on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest Instagram, pull interesting
 pictures that need more context.
 First things first, as a college football
 diehard, do you have a favorite memory from your
 day doing long snaps at Memorial Stadium
 in Lincoln, Nebraska?
 That was the best.
 Shout out to Jeremiah Searles. I mean, I feel
 like that was like that
 was a dream come true. I you know,
 there's a couple of things where
 you can't believe it's happening to you.
 That environment is what's so great
 about college football, like specifically
 what they do in Nebraska.
 It was a thrill, man. The other one,
 by the way, that's been amazing
 is getting to drive press cars.
 So shout out to Matt Fair,
 the smoking tire. I was like,
 Yeah, I'd love to be able to do that. He was like,
 you can't. And then there was a McLaren at my
 house the next day. So
 I love it. While we're on the topic,
 what's your experience with TikTok been like
 so far? Well,
 my experience with TikTok is that
 I'm married to a TikTok addict,
 but she has a whole
 theory on
 how to experience TikTok
 the right way. She says
 that TikTok wants to
 wants you to see like
 people scooping ice cream
 and playing on the sand.
 But there is a deeper, darker
 lane of TikToks
 that you have to find.
 Christina P. on TikTok, she's
 at the water champ, but she
 finds these like
 meth heads, people committing
 crimes, older
 oversexed people, and they're really
 doing amazing work.
 I don't deserve any of the credit.
 She finds all of it and shares
 it with me. And it really is
 remarkable. TikTok is my
 favorite social media platform.
 I just found
 out that my last post was
 deleted because it violated
 community guidelines.
 Well,
 wait till you see what I do next.
 [Music]
 Whoa,
 shit. God damn it.
 Look at that shit.
 All right.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Getting real over here.
 Yeah, it's real.
 Yeah.
 So I want to ask you about Dave
 Chappelle 846 set that dropped recently.
 It's interesting to me in many ways
 because entertainment has found itself
 really flat footed in these months of COVID
 and social unrest. Music in
 particular seems to have dropped the ball
 completely. It hasn't captured anything in the zeitgeist.
 But if you look at
 what is breaking through, it seems to
 be the voices of comedians.
 Does that surprise you at all?
 Or in the comedy world are people just sort of like,
 yeah, of course it would be that way.
 I don't think it's surprising.
 I mean, there's
 really, you know,
 there's amazing
 prolific thinkers.
 Chappelle is one of them.
 He did
 something that is really fucking hot, man.
 Dave's whole
 thing has always been like, if you're not being
 funny, be interesting. It's
 kind of a masterclass in that.
 Forget about like the
 climate and this. See how
 when he's not getting laughs, you're
 still so engaged. That's
 really one of the
 beautiful things about it as a
 piece of art, you know? He's just
 that interesting. Yeah, it's
 interesting that you put it that way because there is a lot
 of talk about whether sets like Chappelle's
 or Hanna Gadsby's specials are funny
 in the traditional sense of a standup act.
 Do you think that that's just like think
 peace fighter or do you see something broader
 shifting? Yeah, I mean, I don't
 know if it's if we're going to see
 a huge shift in that is an interesting
 point. Like you could
 you could see more and more people
 do it. But here's the thing. You better be fucking
 good at it. If you're if you're
 like, I'm not going to joke so much. I'm just
 gonna, you know, share my thoughts
 on something. They better be
 really interesting.
 Goddamn it. Yeah.
 Yeah, you're telling me.
 All right. God damn it.
 Tom, I know your mouth
 is on fire right now, but we have a treat
 that will hopefully bring you some comfort. We
 reached out to two of your buddies
 in the comedy world and asked them
 for their burning questions for Tom
 Segura. So here they are. And
 first up, it is host of Tacos
 con todo, a fellow comedian
 Jesus Trejo that has an important
 question for you, Tom Segura.
 What's up, Jesus?
 Hey, Tom.
 You're probably sweating your ass off
 right now. I feel for you.
 Let me help you get your mind off
 of the pain you must be having right now. And
 I want to ask you this. What
 was your favorite
 street joke from when you were a kid?
 Thanks, man.
 Thanks, man. And good luck.
 All the good ones are pretty racist.
 But
 I think, oh my God.
 What was
 what was Moby Dick's
 dad's name? What was Moby Dick's
 dad's name? Papa
 Boner.
 All right. Up next, we have
 our buddy, Burt Kreischer with a very important question.
 Tom Segura,
 comedian Burt Kreischer. You know who I am.
 If you could replace one
 actor as a superhero in a
 superhero franchise, what
 superhero would you play? What
 actor would you replace? And
 what would you bring to the role that you feel that
 that actor does not?
 He had
 so many questions within his question. Why did he
 even allow that? It was so
 what would you be?
 Why would you be him? Why would
 you think what else do you think you could bring to
 the part? What's your fucking question, man?
 I feel like I would
 be Batman. Which Batman
 would I replace? I mean, Val Kilmer is
 obviously. And what would I
 bring to it? I mean, my sister's just I'm more John
 Blaze than him, man.
 All right, Tom, careful around the eyes
 with the napkin. And that was that was
 pretty fucking dumb. You okay?
 I have a lot of anxiety
 right now.
 My mouth hurts.
 And I remember I told your crew
 I remember
 how much this fucking sucked.
 I remember
 the bomb was the one that made me go fuck
 my life. Yep.
 You and me both.
 All right.
 So
 so
 so
 so
 so
 so
 so like many, I'm having a hard
 time with basic manners and etiquette during
 the pandemic. So now it's one
 of comedy's most thoughtful minds in front
 of me. I thought it'd be a great idea
 to get the Tommy Bunns perspective
 on these new everyday life challenges.
 There are reports that flushing
 the toilet releases a plume of potentially
 COVID infected particles up to three
 feet in the air. Are you flushing
 public toilets or is it better to let
 sleeping logs lie?
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 Fuck them.
 Leave it.
 Buffets. RIP
 are too big to fail.
 Fuck a buffet. Who's going to buffet?
 You're going to a buffet now?
 With those fucking animals?
 No way.
 They don't clean
 that shit. And then let me
 bounce a hypothetical off you.
 You see an older woman hobbling
 towards the exit of a drug store
 at the same time as you fucking
 hit her in the neck. What?
 She's clearly over 70 and has
 respiratory issues. Do you hold
 the door open or do you let it
 slam shut for her to fend for herself?
 I mean,
 I'm a gentleman.
 I'm going to hold the door open.
 But I might tell
 her she should stay
 home more often.
 Dude,
 that is
 worse than I remember.
 Oh, my God, dude.
 Oh, my God.
 Can we just call it a wrap?
 You can always call it a wrap, Tommy.
 I don't know. We got to go.
 Oh, my God.
 How hot is this one?
 Very hot. Quite hot.
 Do you have a Mount Rushmore of
 comedy specials for those of us
 who've already seen every episode of 90 Day Fiancé?
 How fucking good is that show?
 It's the best.
 Man.
 Yeah.
 You got to go.
 Delirious.
 Pick your poison, either
 bigger or blacker or bring the pain.
 It has to be on there.
 Oh, my God.
 And then
 I feel like you got to
 you have to give one
 to Carlin.
 You are all diseased or jamming in New York.
 He was the greatest at what he did,
 like the style he did.
 He's a great thinker, too, like we were talking about.
 Like really thoughtful.
 He'd be fascinating to have right now.
 And the last one, I'd probably go with
 killing him softly.
 Dave Chappelle.
 All right, my man.
 Every time I do this,
 I feel like it really helps my
 sinuses.
 Well, there's one positive.
 All right. I made a dab.
 All right. Me, too.
 I put it on there.
 Cheers, buddy. Cheers.
 OK, Tom, here we are at the end of our meal.
 Blazing hot chicken wings down and only one
 stumbling block standing between you
 and Sauce Valhalla.
 Last time you were on the show, we left on a high note
 and this time around, we're hoping to leave fans with
 the same warm and fuzzy feeling.
 What's DJ Dadmout's
 message of hope to the mommies
 out there who eagerly await the
 return of live stand up?
 Yo.
 2020
 fucking sucks.
 But it's building up.
 It's building up tension and pressure.
 You know what happens
 when pressure builds up, Sean?
 What happens? Something pops off,
 man. Something's going to explode.
 We're going to be out there dancing,
 grooving, laughing,
 moving together again
 in huge venues.
 It'll be fun. We'll be able to cough again.
 We'll spit in each other's faces.
 People will be having sex
 in front of other people
 and it'll all be a fun party.
 And we'll be together
 fighting the invisible virus.
 I don't even know what I said. I just hope
 everybody gets their citizenship.
 The streets have spoken
 and look at you, Tom Segura,
 back for another round of hot ones
 and cleaning the board
 for the second time.
 Now there's nothing left to do, but roll out
 the red carpet for you, Tom Segura.
 This camera, or possibly a camera B
 if you set one up, let the people
 know what you have going on in your life.
 Oh my God. Well,
 I am
 podcasting a lot. Your Mom's House
 podcast, Two Bears, One Cave,
 Tom Segura en Espanol.
 We're doing
 a lot of original content.
 We're putting it on all our YouTube
 channels, on Instagram.
 I'll try to get back to stand up.
 Hopefully I'll be on stage soon
 and on tour in the city
 near you.
