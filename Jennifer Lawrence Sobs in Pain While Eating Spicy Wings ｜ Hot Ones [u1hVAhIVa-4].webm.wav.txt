 (thudding)
 - Whoa!
 I feel like I'm gonna die!
 - I know, I get it.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Jennifer Lawrence.
 She's an Academy Award winning actress
 whose career includes everything
 from billion dollar box office franchises
 to beloved character performances
 in films like Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle,
 Winter's Bone, and many more.
 She also produces and stars in the brand new comedy
 No Hard Feelings, which is set to release
 in theaters on June 23rd.
 Jennifer Lawrence, welcome to the show.
 - Hi, thank you for having me.
 I mean, I think.
 - Yeah, right.
 We'll revisit that here at the end.
 How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 - I'm okay, but I'm going into this very humble.
 - Smart, smart.
 - I mean, I don't think I have that high
 of a pain tolerance.
 - Well, I guess we'll find out today.
 - Yeah.
 - Are you ready to get started?
 - Yeah, sure.
 (dramatic music)
 - Oh, we're going right to left.
 - Yeah, and that's very important.
 - Oh, yeah, sure.
 Okay.
 That's tasty.
 But I would call it like a, yeah, one.
 I think that's a fair start.
 - So the idea of an R-rated comedy like No Hard Feelings
 is really appealing to a movie fan like me,
 especially because so few of them are made these days.
 What was the project's draw for you,
 and how much of a challenge was it
 to get a film like this actually made?
 - So I've known the writer and director Gene Stupnetsky
 for years.
 He's a long, long time friend,
 and he showed me this Craigslist ad
 that the movie's based on.
 And we were just dying laughing about the ad
 and the idea of parents actually doing this.
 You know, four years ago, I get the script,
 and it was the funniest thing I've ever read.
 So we were like, let's go.
 And I didn't even want to work.
 I wasn't gonna work for a long time,
 and I just, we wanted to make it as soon as possible.
 - And then was there any sort of technique
 or original source material to draw from
 for your reaction to getting throat punched
 at the Princeton party?
 - No, that was something I was really trying
 to kind of taper down.
 I didn't want to go too big,
 but then you are getting punched in the larynx.
 So that comes with its own sounds,
 and then kind of the panic of not knowing
 when you're gonna be able to breathe.
 But the scariest part was that it was a stunt shelf,
 and so we really only had one take to get it.
 So that was, there was a lot of pressure.
 - Well, you nailed it.
 You nailed it. - Thank you.
 Well, I did two takes.
 (laughing)
 I had to put the shelf back on.
 I just realized I should only take one bite
 'cause I don't want to get full before I quit.
 I mean, what am I gonna walk away, like here?
 - You're not gonna walk away.
 - Do people just quit without getting to Tim?
 - I don't want to lead the witness,
 or I don't want to cloud anything.
 - 'Cause I watched the show, but like on TikTok,
 where it's like.
 - Right, "Tron KD don't see the end."
 Well, you know what?
 We've never had a woman tap out on this show,
 ever in the history of the show.
 - Classic.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah.
 That is my female producing partner before I went on.
 She was like, "You have to make it to 10."
 - Right, and we are.
 - And I was like, "Oh my God, I do."
 - We are.
 - So yeah, okay, all right.
 - So I imagine one interesting, maybe difficult part
 of making movies is working alongside people
 who have a different process than your own.
 Is there a type of acting prep that you're most intrigued by
 seeing up close and personal?
 - No, I mean, I would be nervous to work with somebody
 who's method 'cause I would have no idea how to talk to them.
 - Right.
 - 'Cause like, do I have to be in character?
 That would just like make me nervous.
 But I don't know, I haven't seen another process
 that I've been curious about.
 'Cause you don't really, you don't know about them.
 - Right. - All the time.
 - Is it just as easy for you to turn that switch off now
 as it was early on in your career?
 - That's a really good question, I don't know.
 I had always been very on-off, on-off
 until I did "American Hustle"
 and I worked with Christian Bale,
 who I noticed when the camera started rolling
 and the crew kind of started preparing
 like it was gonna be 10 seconds or whatever to action.
 He would kind of start getting ready.
 And then I saw that and was like,
 that seems like a really good idea.
 And so then I started to do that.
 I hope I'm like Lorde where I'm like, that's a good wing.
 (laughing)
 - So far.
 - Yeah.
 That one's okay, it's not gonna like,
 (imitating plane engine)
 - Like crescendo?
 - Not yet, but that's a good instinct to have by the way.
 'Cause like a lot of times when people come on here,
 maybe they're like not used to something like this,
 they'll bite into it and then off that like initial bite.
 - You're actually tearing up, did you know that?
 - I'm no superhero.
 (laughing)
 I come in here and I struggle the exact same way, you know?
 - This one is getting you?
 - Well, you know, maybe I'm just moved.
 - You're just moved, maybe.
 - Yeah, I'm just moved, I'm just moved.
 But no, and then you know,
 I've been doing this for so many years, you know,
 it's like an athlete, you know,
 like slowing down a little bit, you know,
 the aches and pains, they kinda,
 they go on another couple of days, you know what I mean?
 Putting in these years.
 - I'm surprised you've never had an ulcer.
 - You know, ignorance is bliss, you know what I mean?
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 Just don't go to the doctor and you won't find out.
 - And then they can't take my show away, you know?
 - Wow, all men are the same.
 (laughing)
 - Between losing a tooth, swallowing your nose ring,
 and accidentally getting struck in the face with a glass,
 what stands out as the most distressing onset accident
 you had while shooting "Don't Look Up"?
 - They were both like around Leonardo DiCaprio,
 which was just like embarrassing.
 Like you don't wanna go (imitates snorting)
 and spit something that just got snorted
 through your sinuses and like,
 and Leo was like, "Was that your, what is that?"
 And I was like, "It's my nose ring."
 That was embarrassing, but truly having,
 it wasn't just one tooth, 'cause I have veneers.
 I had a whole section like missing
 and it was height of COVID,
 so I couldn't go to the dentist.
 So I had to do all of "Don't Look Up"
 with just a gaping hole in my mouth.
 Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Leonardo DiCaprio,
 just everybody, I was like.
 (imitates snorting)
 So I guess I would say the missing tooth.
 It must be so exciting for a sauce company
 to be on your show.
 - It is, yeah, they get very excited about it.
 - This one is warm.
 - Starting to move up a little bit.
 Yeah, and it has that kind of like.
 - But the flavor is great.
 I like how sticky it is.
 - Yeah, it has that kind of like molasses finish on it.
 And then this one does have though
 that kind of 30 seconds later,
 kind of hitting, clapping sort of feeling.
 - Yeah, I'm starting to kind of feel it in my eyes.
 - Yeah, me too.
 You know, I was just a wing earlier than you,
 but welcome to the party.
 - Okay.
 - So I'm intrigued by culinary creation of yours.
 Do you remember where you were and what you were doing
 when you invented the chili pizza sandwich?
 And can you walk us through step by step
 how to make it? - Oh my God,
 the chili pizza sandwich.
 You know, Justine, whose house I was in when I invented this,
 she's actually here eating the wings with us.
 Just side note.
 If you want to swing it, grandma.
 - Yeah, we do.
 We have a nice little side party over here.
 - I would say ours was leftover chili,
 so we microwaved the chili.
 I, we, it was me.
 In Kentucky, we put noodles in our chili.
 One piece of pizza as your bottom bun,
 two scoops, heavy scoops of chili,
 and then a second pizza on top as the top.
 It is getting hotter.
 - I know, that's the show.
 That's how it happens. - It's growing.
 - I know, yeah, and you start talking and it activates,
 and we make this whole interview show.
 - Oh, that's what it is. - I get it.
 - 'Cause of the oxygen?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Clever. - Right.
 - Who lines them up?
 Do you do that?
 - Well, shout out to Chris.
 He is in the building.
 Usually he's never here, but this time he is.
 - It's a real skill.
 - Yeah, they actually, it's such a process
 that they go through. - Yeah.
 - Chris and Noah just like keeled over,
 holding their stomachs.
 Like when you open the door,
 you feel like you're walking in on something
 you shouldn't be. - Yeah.
 - But it's through that elbow grease
 that we put together this perfect hot sauce symphony
 that at least you're connecting with on the first half.
 - Yeah, okay, ooh, I'm nervous.
 - So this next one. - I can like see
 the chili flakes.
 So I'm sure you're off wings.
 Are you off chicken?
 - Yeah, actually.
 - All chicken, I bet, yeah.
 - Any sort of chicken sandwich, fried, like whatever,
 it all feels like work to me, you know?
 - Of course.
 - But it always follows me too.
 You know, like you'll go to a restaurant.
 - And people will wanna send you wings.
 - Right, like this is from the kitchen, blah, blah, blah.
 You know, like that whole thing,
 and it's all very nice and it's all very sweet,
 but it's like, you know, it follows.
 - You'd actually think they'd know better.
 - No, but nobody thinks like that, you know what I mean?
 They're just like, there's the chicken wing guy,
 let's give him some wings.
 - No, he must love wings.
 - Yeah, right, I get it.
 - Yeah, I guess that does add up.
 - I get it, I understand.
 - That one wasn't that bad.
 - Chris, I think you...
 (laughing)
 - Is it true that the wardrobe department
 at American Hustle had to make multiple duplicate looks
 because you had a habit of staining dresses,
 snacking on Cool Ranch Doritos between takes?
 - Cheeto dust, yes.
 Well, it was only one costume, it was a white dress,
 and I feel really bad.
 I actually didn't know that until it came out,
 and that was very disrespectful to the costume department.
 Yes, that is true.
 - But an accident, an accident.
 - An accident, you know, I wasn't like, fuck you guys.
 I think also getting the second dress,
 it just encouraged me to, I was like,
 oh, they must have a million of these.
 - Yeah, right.
 - You know, and then it just, it was a domino effect.
 - Fact or fiction, you were hyperventilating so intensely
 during the climactic scene in Mother
 that you actually dislocated a rib?
 - I tore my diaphragm and cracked something in my chest,
 in my diaphragm, yes.
 - Wow.
 - Or my top rib.
 It still clicks to this day.
 - Finally, Liam Hemsworth made the claim
 that you would intentionally eat meals
 with either tuna or garlic
 before the kissing scenes in Mockingjay, confirm or deny?
 - It was not intentional.
 (laughing)
 It was just like what I was eating,
 and then we'd kiss, like he should just, you know,
 get over it.
 (laughing)
 God, I haven't had just like a glass of milk.
 (dramatic music)
 - Very sweet.
 - At first.
 - Yeah, well.
 It's kicking in.
 Is there almost a cinnamon or like a nut?
 - Yeah, yeah, you catch that.
 And then it kind of leaves behind a lot of bite,
 but you're doing great.
 - Ooh, she's warm.
 (laughing)
 - She is warm.
 She is warm.
 - Ooh, and she's warming up.
 - And building a little bit.
 - She's building, yeah.
 Just a sign of what's to come.
 - Ooh.
 - But you're doing great.
 You're doing great.
 - Okay.
 - So there's a story I was reading about Jodie Foster,
 who directed you in The Beaver,
 saying that you'll look back on your career
 in 20 years time and be able to see a pattern
 or see a connection between the work and your life.
 That was almost 15 years ago.
 Are you any closer to seeing that sort of
 what it all means pattern?
 Are you just as puzzled now as you were back then?
 - No, it made sense a little while ago.
 I, it was so funny.
 Well, I don't know if it made sense,
 but I definitely saw a pattern in me playing,
 I guess, parentified children.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Daughters that were kind of put in the,
 in the, you know, given responsibility
 that was too much at the time.
 And I guess, you know, I left home when I was 14
 and I didn't, you know, I did kind of feel like
 I had to be the parent.
 So I guess that did kind of start making sense.
 And now I'm onto a whole different,
 I don't know what in the hell.
 I put, what does this movie mean?
 What am I going to look back and be like,
 and then at the time I just really wanted to date
 20 year olds.
 I love Buick Regals.
 I can feel it in like my gums, like in between my teeth.
 - Yeah, it starts finding all the corners of the couch
 at this point.
 - Smokey.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Garlicy.
 Okay, it's milk time.
 Okay, Chris.
 - Was that right at number seven, properly placed?
 Makes sense.
 - And I was kind of in my head at the beginning.
 I was like, is this show real?
 - Right, no, I get that.
 - And I don't think that anymore.
 - Growing up in the shadow of Churchill Downs,
 do you have any sort of insight or internal calculus
 when deciding on which horse is a good horse
 to place a bet on?
 - I always like to look at the horses
 that look like they're just like, oh my God,
 you know, the ones that are like the most excited.
 They're like, get me out there.
 But I've never once won a race.
 So don't, you know.
 - How would you describe your ideal afternoon itinerary
 at Camp Hiho?
 - Oh my God, at Camp Hiho?
 Well, God, do a little bit of horseback riding
 and swim in the pond.
 I mean, now there's like archery out there.
 And so sometimes I kind of do a little bit of that,
 which is embarrassing.
 I didn't even have to say that.
 I didn't have to admit it.
 Yeah, swimming and horseback riding.
 - And then finally,
 which is a more hoppy anticipated middle school field trip,
 the Louisville Slugger Museum or the Mega Cavern?
 - Oh my God, the caves.
 We went there one time on a school field trip.
 It was sick.
 - Well, speaking of sick, how are we feeling?
 - Not sick.
 - Okay.
 - Hurt, a little hurt.
 - Right, right.
 And it's always a show I have to apologize for.
 And a sauce that I have to apologize for
 is always the next one.
 - Okay.
 - So this is-
 - Oh, this was the one you warned me about this one.
 - Yeah.
 - Am I allowed to say that?
 Okay.
 - It's all right.
 We can pull back the curtain here.
 - All right, I'm gonna coat with milk.
 - I'll follow suit.
 - This is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Oh, good heavens.
 - Yeah, immediately.
 - Oh my God.
 - I know.
 - Ooh.
 - I know, and it doesn't stop again.
 (Hannah moaning)
 I know, I know.
 Hard to swallow.
 And then this is where I'll just say,
 be careful around the eyes.
 - Oh my God, I'm feeling it.
 - I know, I know.
 - I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it, oh my God.
 I saw someone do that on the show.
 - You saw that on TikTok.
 - Yeah, I saw it on TikTok.
 I get the instinct 'cause it just seems like there's more-
 The other two are hotter.
 - So this is me being your friend.
 What you just ate is the hottest,
 most disgusting hot sauce in the world.
 - Okay.
 - Nothing's worse than that.
 And the worst is over.
 - I don't know what to-
 Nothing helps.
 - I know, I know, I know, I know.
 It just grows, it just grows.
 - I'm drooling so much.
 - I get it, I get it, I get it.
 - Is my face okay?
 (laughing)
 Okay.
 So I was-
 Be careful, that's a rental.
 - Okay, let's go.
 Let's go.
 - So I was reading, I was reading that early on
 in your career, you arranged a meeting
 with director Adam McKay and showed up prepared
 with a binder full of notes on Will Ferrell movies.
 Reflecting on the catalog, what in your opinion
 is Will Ferrell's greatest cinematic masterpiece and why?
 - I didn't have an actual binder.
 I just meant how ridiculous it was that I was like 18
 and was like, "I'm gonna set up a general meeting
 "with Adam McKay 'cause I really love his work."
 I mean, at the time he wasn't like, "Adam McKay."
 He was like, "Adam McKay."
 And so, but I just like,
 I was trying to tell him all this stuff
 that I loved about his movies.
 Anchorman, I guess, is like the obvious one, but...
 What's so great about Elf is that
 when you're making a movie, you really don't know.
 You don't know how it's gonna turn out.
 And so to be in an Elf costume, in this green costume,
 just like marching around the city
 and doing all of that and committing like, "Santa!"
 Like that is just really admirable.
 I really respect it a lot.
 - I know.
 I know.
 I know.
 I'm trying to exhale.
 - Yeah.
 - Okay.
 Are you going for the, okay, fine.
 - Oh!
 Whoa!
 - I feel like I'm gonna die!
 - I know, I get it.
 - Have you ever had anybody act like this?
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 Every Hot One shoot is a uniquely singular experience.
 You know?
 - It's a great concept.
 - Oh, thank you, thank you.
 But, so they're all their own unique path.
 But you know what?
 As crazy as it gets on here,
 I've always seen something crazier.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, I've seen some things.
 Not as bad as the bomb, right?
 - No, I get it, I get it.
 - Thank you for like warning me, but I guess.
 - But also.
 - Fuck you for like having it here.
 - No, I get it, I get it.
 - I haven't recovered, it's not getting better.
 Is it getting any better for you?
 - I'm a little bit.
 - Tell me yes, because you're stronger.
 - I'm on the other side of it a little bit.
 I'm on the other side of it slightly.
 - Georgie, is my mascara waterproof?
 - It's actually amazing.
 - Everyone laughed.
 My whole team's just like.
 (laughing)
 - Who you with?
 - She's got it from here.
 How, if at all, did taking a break from acting,
 did it like strengthen or undermine the enjoyment
 that you personally get?
 - It made me a lot stronger.
 - Out of watching movies.
 Like removing yourself from the business,
 how, if at all, does that like impact
 the own personal enjoyment
 that you get out of watching movies?
 - Oh, that's a good question.
 I mean, I don't think so,
 'cause I'm really, I can always watch movies.
 Like they're, you know, I've always loved movies.
 You can get lost in it.
 That's why I like reality TV.
 So what if I just never finished that sentence?
 Because I love movies so much.
 But like, it's a fourth wall thing.
 I can't finish the thought.
 I will notice, you know, great acting
 or like something like, wow, I couldn't do that.
 That's amazing.
 Or, you know, what a beautiful line.
 But I don't really think too much about
 (glass clinking)
 you know, what's going on behind the scenes,
 unless it's like a boring movie.
 And then I start, you know,
 if I'm noticing the camera work,
 it's probably a bad thing.
 Okay, is this one bad?
 What do you mean?
 What do you mean by shaking it?
 What are you doing?
 What do you mean?
 What do you, what do you mean?
 (laughing)
 What do you mean?
 - You don't have to, if you don't want to.
 And I recommend that you don't.
 - I won't.
 (sighing)
 I actually feel better.
 (laughing)
 For the mind trick.
 - And just in time, it's been an amazing journey,
 not through only the spice, but also through your career,
 to bring things full circle.
 From learning to skin squirrels, archery,
 ballroom dancing and beyond.
 - Can you explain learning to skin squirrels?
 'Cause a lot of people won't know.
 - Oh right, so I should just like leave that up
 for no context. - I'm just kidding.
 - Winter's bone, winter's bone.
 All part of the character development,
 all part of the prep, but I'm curious,
 is there a skill, a specialized skill,
 that you've learned over the course of your acting career
 that's been the most valuable or transferable
 to your everyday life?
 - I learned how to pick locks on Red Sparrow.
 I haven't used it, but to know that I could is cool.
 And I learned how to train falcons
 for a movie called Serena.
 Not train them, but go like this.
 - Look at you, Jennifer Lawrence,
 taking on the wings of death, living to tell the tale.
 Now there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - I have no hard feelings coming out June 23rd.
 (audience applauding)
 (gentle music)
 - Did you eat it?
 You stopped after the bomb?
 Pussy.
 (audience laughing)
 - Hello, I'm camera guy Bill.
