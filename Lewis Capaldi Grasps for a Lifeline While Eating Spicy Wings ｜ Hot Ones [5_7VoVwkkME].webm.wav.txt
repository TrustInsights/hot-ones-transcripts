 Am I visibly crying?
 Yeah, yeah, but it looks like cinematic and kind of beautiful actually.
 Well, I'm trying to say to you guys, everybody, no one knows anything.
 You're your own person.
 Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Lewis Capaldi.
 He's a Grammy nominated multi-platinum singer-songwriter
 who just released his long awaited sophomore album.
 It's called Broken by Desire to be Heavenly Sent.
 The latest single is Wish You the Best.
 Check out the video and bring a box of tissues.
 Lewis Capaldi, welcome to the show.
 Hello. I'm nervous.
 Well, there's no need to be nervous.
 No need to be nervous.
 How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 I know I think you're the first Scottish palate that we put to the test on this.
 Yes. First Scottish person on here feels good.
 I feel like I'm going to let a nation down here.
 But yeah, I'm good.
 I've already taken what I feel will be my last sort of bearable shit today.
 Did you do it here?
 I've done it here.
 Oh, amazing.
 Yeah, I've shot here.
 Who else is?
 I was just thinking maybe Jake Gyllenhaal was taking a dump in here.
 This is beautiful.
 This one, here we go.
 Mm. So delightful.
 Delightful little sauce.
 We're on the way.
 Sometimes people come on, take a bite.
 Oh, sorry.
 I was just I was just enjoying it.
 I felt like we were on a date there and I was just enjoying.
 We are on a date.
 Yeah, we can think about that.
 Yeah, of course.
 You just take some more.
 I know. I know.
 That was kind of just an impulse.
 Okay.
 I'm not trying to show off over here.
 No, I don't think I'll eat all of them all the time.
 But while they're in this sort of comfortable zone, we'll take big swings.
 There we go.
 So as I know you're aware, there's a current TikTok trend of people in tears,
 warning others against watching your new music video for Wish You The Best,
 as it's a one way ticket to crying your face off.
 Yeah.
 RIP to John and Willow.
 What's been your reaction to the reaction?
 Because from your duets, it would seem like you get some sort of sick pleasure
 out of watching your fans cry.
 Yeah, I enjoy it.
 I think what's nice is I've always wanted to be viral on TikTok.
 I've always wanted to be viral on TikTok.
 I never thought I would get there by trying to get a lot of people to
 by traumatising children.
 But if that's paying the bills, then so be it.
 But yeah, it's good, man.
 I'm just like, I like to see people suffering is what I'm trying to say.
 And this is...
 Well, me too, me too, you know.
 Yeah, I often, should I say, and not to talk about assholes too much,
 I often think about your asshole, Sean.
 You do?
 Yeah, I often think that poor thing.
 You put it through so much.
 And I wonder, like, I was thinking maybe like it's like the battle of the
 Psalm down there, but I think actually it must be pristine.
 Actually, it's closer to pristine than the former.
 Yes.
 You know what I mean?
 I'm battle tested.
 Upkeep.
 Yeah.
 You're like sort of taking care of your asshole in a way that no one else does.
 And yeah, but I just often, I say a prayer every time I go to watch one of these.
 Well, thank you for praying for me.
 Yeah, don't worry.
 Thank you for praying for me.
 Yeah, don't you worry.
 Are you ready to move on here to sauce number two?
 I fucking guess so.
 So this next one, we've got the curry verde here in the two spot.
 That's nice.
 A little zesty.
 I remember DJ Khaled like tapped out.
 By the way, I'm going to be a fucking mess by the end of this.
 Let's go.
 Let it fly.
 Does anyone just, so what happens then?
 You just not eat the wings and talk?
 Yeah, kind of.
 That's when from like my perspective, I got to think on the fly a little bit.
 You know what I mean?
 Cause somebody is like disengaging from the thing, but then you have to like, that's,
 that's when the format of the show becomes a challenge for the host of the show.
 Yeah.
 And then it just, the whole thing is, yeah, you should have kicked DJ Khaled the fuck out of here.
 And you should have said, listen, you, if you don't eat your food, fuck off.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No, that's mental freeze.
 Pretty wild sort of thing.
 But that's lovely.
 I love that.
 Where'd it go?
 So I understand that you began performing at 11 years old, doing pubs throughout the UK
 where you'd often hide in the bathroom before the show to avoid getting kicked out for being under age.
 What was the significance of the Grange bar and Foldhouse at that time in your young career?
 Wow.
 Fucking hell.
 You need to do one of these with Nardwaj, do you know that?
 I know.
 I love Nardwaj.
 I'd be like the fucking, the king, like the two kings at it.
 Do you know what I mean?
 But, um, yeah, no, the Grange was good.
 We did some like covers gigs in there.
 My friend, Adam Warrington, who plays guitar now for Youngblood, which is quite interesting.
 But no one gave a fuck.
 No one gave a fuck about me and Adam playing.
 They hate, they actually disliked us playing gigs.
 Yeah.
 Did you ever have to deal with hecklers in a pub environment like that?
 All the time.
 Yeah, all the time.
 Like, oh, when's, they need to be home early for school and fucking, you look like a piece of shit.
 Cause we were coming on and trying to sing new songs, like the weed writing and stuff.
 And I think people just wanted to dance, which I have no, I totally understand, but, um, who's laughing now?
 Fuck you.
 But it was great.
 It was great fun.
 The Grange, it used to be owned by my friend, David, who, um, David Barry and they, they, they were great.
 They used to always let us in.
 They don't own the pub now, so I can say this, but we were underage and we were able to come in and like, they would let us play.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So, uh, yeah, great stuff.
 Well, shout out to them.
 Shout out to them.
 Getting those 50,000 hours in.
 The police are coming to your house now, motherfuckers.
 So far, this is delightful little.
 So far.
 Yeah.
 It's like you're lulling me in.
 Yeah, right.
 And we're shifting gears on you.
 It's coming at you from all angles over here.
 You're teasing me a little bit.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 We don't want you to be comfortable over here.
 No, I like it.
 That's lovely.
 That.
 So I love your quote about songwriting where you dispelled the myth that the best records come the easiest saying the best songs come from me, sitting at a piano, bashing my head against a brick wall for hours on end to get one good melody.
 What's the longest length of time you've ever taken to write a song from beginning to end?
 I mean, there's ones that I'm still not finished that I don't think I'll ever get finished.
 But like someone you loved was I started it in August 2018 and finished it in like September 2019.
 So you're talking no, sorry.
 The other way around 17 to 2018, October 2017 and then finished it in like September 2018.
 Just a few months before it came out.
 So it's almost like a year to write the one song.
 Yeah, I should have said a year.
 That's better.
 But songwriting for me is like people say it's like catharsis and all the rest of it.
 It's a beautiful thing.
 But catharsis isn't always comfortable or enjoyable.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I think I spend most of my time hating myself when I'm writing songs.
 And yeah, I think that's fine.
 I think that's okay.
 That's my process.
 But yeah, I just I subject the general public to the pain of listening to my music.
 So I feel like I should have to suffer as well.
 I love it.
 Mmm.
 More of a barbecue.
 Not too much of a kick.
 But it's usually a kick sport.
 I feel like this is the first sauce that takes a jump that's more than just one step.
 You know, but look at you.
 Cleaning the wing.
 Cleaning the wing?
 Fuck you, Ed Sheeran.
 Is the best pizza you've ever had still found at Tony's Fish Bar in West Lothian?
 Or do you have a new number one slice from your world?
 Yeah, Tony's is good.
 Also mad hearing you say that.
 Tony's is great.
 Shout out to Tony's.
 Although actually, fuck them.
 Because I've shouted those bastards out.
 I lived on the same street as them when I was growing up.
 And never once did I get a free pie slung my way.
 So fuck that.
 These guys, if you're listening, Berto, where the fuck was my free slices?
 They do a good garlic mayonnaise, I'll say that.
 But it's great pizza.
 But also, I said fuck, you're in the same boat as Ed Sheeran.
 Tony's Fish Bar.
 I'm fucking dicking on these so far.
 You're dicking on them.
 You're dicking on them, baby.
 I have a thing to show you.
 A surprise?
 Um, I'm guessing it's got my cock out.
 That'd be amazing.
 But no, go ahead.
 We met.
 Mm-hmm.
 It's just, do you have this on a thing?
 No.
 No, but let's chat about it.
 We met in a nightclub.
 We did.
 What was the nightclub?
 Was it called Delilah?
 Shout out to Milo.
 Lot of ass shaking going on in there.
 I saw just titties right when I walked in.
 I didn't know.
 I didn't know that was the thing.
 I didn't know you could do that.
 And I walked in, I was like, this place is not my scene.
 I feel like we were both maybe a little bit fish out of water.
 Yeah, yeah.
 No, I don't know.
 Maybe that's your vibe.
 Maybe you love walking into clubs and seeing titties.
 I was like, when I walked in, I was like, I saw peripherally just hands, you know,
 and like excitement.
 Yeah.
 So then I look over and I was like, oh, do I have some friends here?
 And I look over and I see you and Niall.
 Me and Niall Horan.
 And I was so excited to see Sean Evans.
 I was fucking buzzing.
 Like, I fucking love this show.
 Love you.
 You're my titties.
 I love you back.
 Oh, you're my titties.
 I get excited when I see you.
 But I said to you at the time, you probably don't know me, my name's Lewis Capaldi.
 Sean did know me.
 He does his research.
 Of course he did.
 Good man.
 And you were like, I was like, one day I hope to come on your show.
 And you were like, I'm sure you will.
 And I said, but just in case I don't, can you record an intro for me on my phone?
 And I've still got it.
 You do?
 Yeah.
 Can I play this?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So I put it here.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Not that anything's here.
 There's nothing right here.
 Um, okay.
 What's going on everybody?
 For First Week Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Outones.
 It's the show without questions and even out of wings.
 And today we're joined by Lewis Capaldi.
 And you can hear me in the back, fucking out, it's so buzzing.
 But yeah, huge day for me.
 And sent it all the pals, coolest thing that's ever happened to me.
 And here we fucking are.
 Here we fucking are.
 Halfway through the week.
 Full circle, full circle.
 Beautiful.
 Okay.
 Here we go.
 Let's go a little bit of a thing.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's happening a little bit.
 It's getting real.
 That's getting a little bit neppy.
 Maybe I'll slow down on this wing.
 Doesn't look like it.
 Oh, that's good.
 There we go.
 I can handle that.
 I'm getting so scared because I know what's coming.
 So I've heard you talk about being surprised by the success of your song
 Bruises.
 What do you learn as an artist when your expectations for a record are exceeded?
 I'm getting there, I'm salivating and crying slightly now.
 Okay.
 Fucking you asked me a question.
 I did.
 I did.
 You motherfucker.
 Okay.
 It's hot now.
 Fuck you.
 Careful around the eyes.
 Careful around the eyes.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Sorry.
 Fucking Jenna Ortega.
 She can fucking handle a wing.
 Question.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Was a good one.
 Thank you.
 You just learn that you don't know anything because it's like, no one
 has the answer because it just shows you that you don't know what a hit is.
 Anytime I put a song out thinking this is going to be a smash.
 It's been a fucking complete abject fucking failure.
 Right.
 And so, yeah, you know nothing and labels know nothing and like no one
 knows anything not to no offense, but no one knows anything.
 It's just like, yeah, we just kind of, I'm a visibly crying.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But it looks like cinematic and kind of beautiful actually.
 It is everybody.
 No one knows anything.
 You your own person.
 Oh fuck.
 That's hot.
 No, I know.
 I kind of chilling out now though.
 Yeah.
 But you know, the problem with the show is right, right.
 When it chills out, the next bus pulls up to the station.
 Yeah.
 I said, I'm not going to wait my face.
 I want people to see what's the real, the honest, the truth.
 And that's what I am.
 Yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 That's one looks innocent.
 Here we go.
 Here we go.
 Cheers.
 That tastes really nice at first.
 Okay.
 So when we had your friend now horn on the show, he said that your most Scottish
 trait is that you talk too fast for people to understand you and that he believes
 that you do so on purpose, especially when you're talking to Americans confirm or
 deny.
 I can confirm that sometimes I've got friends from my England who can't
 understand me, but sometimes I think people are just being like, Oh, what are
 you saying?
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Right.
 Americans make a more, more of an effort to understand what I'm saying.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 Whereas English people can sometimes just be especially posh English people can
 just be like pricks for the sake of like, you know what I mean?
 I can't understand a word you're saying.
 I love you, England.
 Do you ever go to Celtic FC chant?
 You know, something I can have in my back pocket.
 Should I ever find myself?
 Oh, fuck.
 I'm trying to remember.
 Oh, there's another thing here.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They're all yours.
 You got the lifelines over there.
 Bird box.
 Fuck me, man.
 That's heating up.
 Um, I don't know.
 There's a really beautiful soul called grace.
 It's an old Irish song, but it's Sealdi fan-sing because there's that big
 connection with Ireland, but it's a, it's a beautiful tune.
 As we gathered in the chapel here, down old Kilmainan jail, I think about these
 last few weeks, oh, my eyes are...
 It's like I've got like a pair of sunglasses on that have been in an oven.
 Right, here we go.
 I'm a bit, I'm really nervous.
 Me too.
 Cause I know this one's shit.
 Yeah.
 And I can hear the editing on the background that's going, the music getting higher.
 Reaching fever pitch.
 Here we go.
 And then the beat's about to start.
 It's like, wee!
 Something like that, do you know what I mean?
 Here we go.
 It's happening.
 Oh, that's too much.
 Yeah, that's big.
 Oh, fuck you.
 Yeah, that's a bitch, isn't it?
 That is a, that's a whore.
 Yeah.
 That is a whore of a sauce.
 And you know, like on the other ones, they kind of start to build, you know, but it
 takes a while.
 This one builds so fast and then it just doesn't stop.
 It's at the back of my mouth.
 Yeah.
 It's getting worse and worse and worse.
 It's like the, it's the devil's of Jackie.
 Oh, fuck you, Sean.
 It's the little spin.
 I know, I know.
 Ask me a fucking question.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 So, you know, I've been following along with the press tour and it seems like you're
 holding onto your vow to stay on Tinder until the day that you die.
 Fuck me.
 What do you think is an appropriate amount of money to spend on a first date?
 Oh, nothing.
 Oh, fuck.
 That's good, man.
 That's good.
 The lemonade hitting.
 You wanted to go with the citrus.
 Shit.
 That is hot.
 It's the show.
 Here's the thumbnail.
 I've got to change the shirt, don't I?
 Oh, fuck you.
 I know.
 I know.
 Milk.
 I don't like milk.
 And then Lewis, this is just going to be me.
 This is me being your buddy.
 I know that the liquids are helping out.
 Set through it.
 But let's slow it down just a little bit, because sometimes, you know, when you're
 mixing hot sauce and liquids, the liquids can become more of a problem than the hot
 sauce.
 Thanks for telling me that.
 I thought I could have that.
 Do you know what?
 I let you go to a level and then once it starts to get a little dicey, the foundation
 gets a little shaky.
 That's when I speak up.
 I'm easing out.
 Right?
 On the other side of it.
 Fucking Jenna Ortega.
 I imagine.
 I mean, what is going on there?
 What was the question?
 Appropriate amount of money to spend on a first date.
 Fuck it, who cares, man?
 You might never meet that person again.
 Right, right, right.
 Get in, make some sweet, sweet fucking love.
 I'm in.
 Who are you again?
 I feel like I'm talking about like Austin Butler and all of a sudden I'm nominated for
 Oscars.
 I feel high.
 So that always happens.
 And you know what?
 The more I do this show, the easier it is for me to catch that high.
 Yeah.
 So now I float like every episode around this time.
 It's amazing.
 Oh, that one's all right.
 Yeah, I think again, just because the bomb clears everybody off the paint.
 Fuck me.
 That was good.
 You got some good content there.
 Always with you.
 Yeah.
 I told you I'd be sweating.
 So an AI hit by a fake drink kicked off a lot of discussion and controversy amongst record
 labels, streamers and artists.
 Do you have an opinion yet on the proliferation of AI created music?
 I don't know.
 God, that was bad.
 It's like a second dose.
 I know.
 I don't care.
 It's a second dose.
 It's like a second dose.
 I don't care.
 It's like a second dose.
 It's like a second dose.
 I don't care.
 I mean, I do.
 I probably have a more thought opinion on it, but right now it's hard to really collect
 my thoughts.
 Yeah, I just in case it overrules and we become its slaves.
 Yeah, right.
 I love you, baby.
 Like your worries about AI are more in the realm of like sentient machine gun mounted
 robot dogs.
 Not necessarily.
 I'm going to be fucked by a machine.
 Right.
 So if they come up with a song using your voice, then who cares?
 Who cares?
 Yeah.
 Fuck me.
 Good to be here.
 Thank you so much, Lewis.
 Just as dabbing on the last one.
 That's what we're doing, baby.
 That's what we're doing.
 This is...
 Oh, I just blew it into my eye.
 Oh my gosh.
 Right at the finish line.
 Okey dokey.
 You don't have to if you don't want to, but it looks like it's going there.
 Jesus.
 I thought it was going to be thicker than that.
 That's what she said.
 Hey!
 Hey-o.
 Fuck.
 All right.
 Cheers, Lewis.
 What a ride.
 What a ride, baby.
 This has been fun and I hope to never see you again.
 I understand.
 Yes, tastes nice.
 At first.
 At first.
 Fuck you.
 Oh, one of those and that was a lot, Lewis.
 Yeah.
 But don't worry.
 This one's got a nice long wind up.
 Okay.
 Cool.
 Yeah, to bomb really fucking...
 That was one of the vows of a panic attack.
 It changes the game.
 Changes the game.
 But thankfully our long overdue dinner date with the wings of death, it's behind us, baby.
 And to close things out, you've been open about your struggles with imposter syndrome
 and benefiting from the counsel of stars like Elton John and Ed Sheeran.
 With the heat of a million suns coursing through your veins right now, do you have any
 foundational advice for people struggling with feelings of inadequacy even when their
 lives are seemingly otherwise going well?
 That is such a good question and you asked it at the complete wrong time.
 Ask that first.
 But listen, if you're out there and you feel inadequate, it's probably just because you are.
 If you're feeling like an imposter and you shouldn't be able to do the things you're
 doing, it's probably because you suck.
 If you're feeling like your girlfriend doesn't love you and she's going to leave you, she
 probably will.
 You're going to die alone, everybody, is what I'm trying to say to you.
 Life is meaningless, what I'm trying to say.
 After this I realize none of this means anything.
 And hell is awaiting us all.
 Straight talk from Lewis Capaldi and not a dry eye in the house after that motivational
 speech.
 And look at you, taking on the wings of death, living to tell the tale.
 Now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera, let the people know what you have going on in
 your life.
 I've got an album coming out.
 It's a piece of fucking flaming shit, don't listen to it.
 But please just hit buy it.
 I've got a mortgage now and it's crippling.
 So, DJ Khaled, if you're out there, eat my shit.
 This was fun.
 I don't know what else to say.
 Fuck me, that is...
 You've got a serious game on your hands here.
 I'm sorry for swearing at you.
 I was, you know, going through something.
 I understand completely.
 That was good fun.
 Here I am feeding you wings with the bomb.
 What are you going to do, not curse me out?
 Hey, hey, look at us.
 Look at us.
 Who would have thought, Lewis, who would have thought?
 Mm-mm.
 God, me, that was fucking great.
 Thank you, man.
 Thank you so much for watching today's video.
