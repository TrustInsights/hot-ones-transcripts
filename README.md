# Transcripts of Seasons 12-21 of the YouTube Series Hot Ones

As part of our [Trust Insights weekly newsletter](https://www.trustinsights.ai/newsletter), we performed an analysis of seasons 12-21 of the YouTube series Hot Ones. The raw transcripts produced by OpenAI's Whisper Large-V1 model are provided here for other researchers who want to use the data in their own research.

The transcripts are NOT diarized (speakers identified), and have not been altered in format from what Whisper produced.
