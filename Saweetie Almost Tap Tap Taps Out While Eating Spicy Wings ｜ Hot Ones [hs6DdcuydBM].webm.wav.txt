 (dramatic music)
 (shouts)
 - That feels like a face mask in my throat.
 (laughs)
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Saweetie.
 She's the chart topping rapper you know
 from singles like "Icy Girl", "Tap In" and "My Type".
 Her debut album, "Pretty Bitch Music"
 is set to drop very soon.
 So today she's gonna tap in with the wings of death.
 Saweetie, welcome to the show.
 - What's up?
 - I know that you used to eat hot Cheetos
 in the morning for breakfast.
 So I take it you have a taste for the spicy stuff.
 - You know what?
 I only used to like hot Cheetos, nothing else hot.
 But over the years I've learned to love spicy food.
 Kind of scared though, because there's levels.
 After a certain level, I don't know if I can hang.
 So we gonna find out.
 (upbeat music)
 - Classic hot sauce.
 (satisfied moaning)
 It's sweet, and spicy.
 That's real good right there.
 I need some of this at the house.
 This is delicious.
 Where has this been all my life?
 - Just waiting for you to be on the show
 so we can send the whole gauntlet to your house I think.
 - Okay, one more bite.
 I don't wanna get too full,
 but this is actually really good.
 Do I get to keep this?
 - It's all yours.
 - Oh, okay.
 - So I wanna start by talking about the Saweetie blueprint
 because in just a few short years
 you went from doing freestyles in traffic
 to churning out top 40 radio hits,
 in large part because of your ability
 to fully leverage the power of the internet.
 I don't think it's a coincidence that you trend on TikTok
 with almost every new release.
 Can you share any inside baseball
 on what takes a hit single and propels it
 to also being a viral dance craze?
 - I'm not really sure what the secret sauce is
 to what propels my songs on TikTok.
 I would just say like, I'm really normal.
 So I talk about normal things
 that people can relate to.
 So I think it all comes down to relatability
 and they relate to my lyrics.
 And I think that's what draws people in.
 So it's just nice to see that they like what I like.
 First it's sweet and then it's like spicy.
 Got some kick to it.
 It like makes my soul dance.
 My soul is hitting the splits right now.
 (laughing)
 - So like many young artists,
 you have a savvy understanding of cyber marketing
 and you can really back it up with a degree from USC
 where you studied business and worked
 as a research assistant.
 As someone like myself, who should maybe read
 their own contracts a little bit more closely,
 I'm curious, what advice would you have
 for a young artist entering their first label deal?
 Like are there sneaky terms you'd tell them to look out for?
 - Yeah, I would ask for an expanded contract deal
 because they do give condensed contract deals.
 And if you have a lawyer that's not aware,
 the lawyer won't pick it up.
 So I would definitely...
 (coughing)
 I'm not even eating anything hot.
 My throat.
 - On that note, is there anything that you'd look for
 if you were signing an appearance release
 for say an interview show where you had to eat
 violently hot chicken wings?
 - Oh yeah.
 You know, just in case they died,
 like if the hot sauce was too hot,
 you know, just making sure that there was a lucrative payout.
 (laughing)
 Oh, Shaquanda.
 Looks like she could make some hot sauce.
 It's good.
 I would eat this with like chicken and rice.
 - So your earliest releases were a throwback
 to the all verse, no chorus roots of old school rap.
 Do you think that that early education and freestyling,
 do you think that informed on a literary level
 or even on an academic level, how you approach songwriting?
 - I write better when I just write freely.
 So that's why I feel like my best work comes from,
 you know, the songs with no choruses,
 like Pretty Bitch Freestyle, like Icy Girl, like Anti.
 So I had to learn that this is not an essay
 and I had to kind of break through that creative box
 that I had placed around my head while I was in college.
 I had to start to get back in touch with my,
 like my creative, you know, juice
 and I had to get it flowing again.
 Angry Gold.
 Well, I hope it don't taste angry.
 Ew.
 I don't like this one.
 Look.
 Tastes like Lucas in a bottle.
 Not digging that one.
 - I'm not.
 I don't wanna just skip to the next one.
 This is the best one so far.
 - We'll take it.
 - I'm gonna eat about like 10 bottles of that.
 Okay, let's just hop right into this one.
 - All right, but I'll hit you with some questions from Four.
 Does that sound good?
 - Yep.
 - So from dropping lyrics about fettuccine
 to doing full blown seafood pasta tutorials,
 it's clear that the culinary connections with Sweetie,
 they run deep.
 You speak of oysters almost like they're a religion.
 Where do you stand on the great debate of raw versus cooked?
 - I love raw oysters and actually,
 it was funny that you said that
 because this would taste amazing on some oysters.
 - Where would you ballpark the most oysters
 that you've ever eaten in one sitting?
 - 24.
 - Damn.
 - Yeah, I had two dozen.
 One for an appetizer and one to close out my dinner.
 (laughing)
 - Ladies, do not be shy on your dates.
 Order whatever you want.
 - I don't know, what y'all put in this?
 But y'all put some crack in this.
 - All right, Sweetie, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So I'll show you the picture.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 - Okay.
 - So your grandfather, Willie Harper,
 played alongside Joe Montana for the 49ers.
 Who throws a tighter spiral, you or Quavo?
 - Me, of course, no questions.
 I was female athlete of the year.
 So my name is forever gonna be in the gym
 for being female athlete of the year.
 - What were your sports?
 - Track, volleyball, and powder puff.
 Hey, I got an arm, like Bradford.
 (laughing)
 I'm determined, you know.
 - I can see it.
 - I'm trying to be, when someone asks,
 I want you to be like, yeah, Sweetie,
 actually, you know, completed the course.
 So I'm a dip it.
 I'm a dip it and I'm a sniff it.
 Ooh, ooh, mm.
 I don't know if I like it.
 Ooh, it's burning the back of my throat, but it's good.
 Take a bite this time.
 This makes sense.
 With Scorpios, you don't know if you want to love them
 or if you want to fight them.
 - I can't decide if I like this or if I don't like it.
 It's good.
 - So you're among a select group of people
 who'll be able to say that they dropped an album
 in the throes of a global pandemic.
 And I get the sense that like many of us,
 you're someone who associates music
 with certain times in your life.
 How do you think people will remember the music
 that they listened to in this year?
 - It serves as some sort of like escapism.
 So I think I feel like the good music that is put out,
 people will remember it for like giving them good memories
 or making like their dark days lighter.
 I mean, at least when I make music,
 I make it to, you know, inspire people,
 to make people feel better,
 to make people want to go out and get that back.
 So hopefully when I come out with my music,
 it makes them smile or it's like therapeutic
 for like whatever situation they're going through.
 Woo!
 Who's made it all the way to like the end?
 - So believe it or not,
 we've been doing this show now for 13 seasons
 and had almost 200 people come in
 and then fewer than like 15 have ever tapped out.
 Most everybody gets through,
 even though it does get a little weird over here.
 - All right, well, you know I'm a competitive girl, so.
 - I know.
 - I got four left.
 - That's right.
 - Oh my gosh.
 It got seven skull heads out of 10 skull heads.
 Ugh!
 That's not even hot.
 That tastes like cognac in a bottle.
 That tastes like Hennessy on fire.
 Who the hell made this?
 - There's actually like a barrel aged bourbon in that one.
 I love that, cognac in a bottle.
 - Oh duh, yeah, this tastes like straight hot alcohol.
 Mm-mm.
 - So the meteoric success of your debut single
 not only marked your arrival in the music industry,
 but also launched an army of internet savvy supporters
 known as the Icy Gang.
 I know you love that quote,
 "No man is your enemy, no man is your friend,
 every man is your teacher."
 Do you think that there's value in listening to the critics?
 - Yes, when they actually have something to say
 and it's not like I wish you would just go and die somewhere.
 'Cause they do get that, you know, that gruesome.
 And just sometimes it's just like,
 who the hell is on the other side of this account?
 Because they're very miserable for them to even say like,
 I get like really like gruesome sort of DMs
 where I'm just like, I'm happy that I come
 from such a loving place 'cause I know that they're tripping.
 But for people who are not as strong minded,
 like imagine when they read it and how they feel.
 - I've seen you push back on people
 who think of the icy theme
 as somehow being literally jewelry.
 Why is it important for you to push back on that?
 - When I break it down, I always tell people like,
 I meet a lot of bad bitches
 who have stank attitudes and they're ugly to me.
 So when I mean pretty, I mean like your energy,
 how you treat people.
 Are you loving? Are you kind?
 So it's just like, pretty to me is more of an aura,
 more of an energy and icy is like a mentality.
 (dramatic music)
 All right, here goes nothing.
 (dramatic music)
 (sighing)
 - Good.
 Getting kind of hot in here.
 - Amazing.
 - Woo.
 (grunting)
 - Yeah.
 (gurgling)
 - Ah.
 Give me some milk.
 Give me some milk.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Give me some milk.
 (grunting)
 - Oh no, she's tethered.
 - Oh my gosh.
 Oh.
 Girl, give me.
 Oh my gosh.
 Mm.
 - That's a crazy one.
 (grunting)
 - That feels like a face mask in my throat.
 (grunting)
 I know how it goes.
 I know how it goes.
 You just chill for a second.
 (gasping)
 - Somebody call my grandma so she can pray for me.
 Oh my God.
 I can't even see.
 - It's all right.
 Just listen.
 Just listen.
 I'll wind this one up for a while for you, okay?
 Okay.
 - So you stand on the shoulders of giants in the Bay Area.
 One of those pioneers is Mac Dre,
 AKA the thizzer devise,
 AKA the inventor of all things thiz.
 I think now is as good a time as any.
 What's the key to making a perfect thiz face?
 - Oh my gosh.
 My tongue's about to fall out.
 Oh my gosh.
 Mm.
 That's a thiz face.
 It was a hot sauce thiz face.
 I wouldn't make it.
 I can't even make the thiz face 'cause...
 Mm.
 Yeah, I'm not even being dramatic.
 I can't even talk right now.
 - What does it mean to say I got these wings for Jug?
 - Mm.
 It means you got it for the low.
 You got it for cheap.
 You got it for a discount.
 - Do you have a most memorable sideshow experience?
 - Yeah, my cousin was doing donuts
 and I was in the passenger seat and it was so smoky.
 He almost took off with half my leg out the car.
 - All right, how you doing, okay?
 - Y'all, I feel like I'm about to die.
 The only person I can handle that is the devil.
 I can't hear.
 I can't see.
 I get it, I get it.
 And you know what?
 I wish that we were in the studio
 so I could kind of be a calming influence.
 I know it's not easy here over the Zoom.
 - I'm gonna cry right now.
 - It's crazy, it's crazy.
 - For all my girls who's watching,
 my throat feel like when you do three charcoal masks
 back to back to back.
 - We've all been there.
 - Grandma, if you watching, I'm sorry for Foxes.
 - It's all right, long leash, long leash here on Hot Ones.
 - I feel like I just got my ass beat.
 - You don't look like someone who got their ass beat.
 - I'm not gonna lie, that just ruined all my insides.
 I'm gonna lick it,
 but I can't stick it in my throat no more.
 - Listen, lick, it's fine with me, it's fine with me.
 If you lick, that's fine.
 I do worry that maybe licking could be worse.
 - Oh Lord.
 (soft music)
 - All right, I got one more left.
 - Do you still love Costco hot dogs
 or has success changed you?
 - Well, if I'm still eating Top Ramen,
 you know I'm for sure still eating Costco hot dogs.
 - As a diehard Disney fan,
 which singing princess would make for the best feature
 on Bad Bitch Music?
 - Wow, I've never been asked this before.
 I mean, she wasn't a princess, but I would say Tinkerbell.
 She's sassy and she about her business
 and she don't take no shit.
 This was a traumatic experience for me.
 Oh my gosh.
 My uncle even came up here for a little bit.
 He gave me the sad look he went down back downstairs.
 (laughing)
 (soft music)
 - All right, man.
 Cheers.
 - Cheers, cheers.
 - Hey, this better not be hotter than this one.
 If you do, I'm gonna fight you.
 - All right, let me see how big your dab is.
 This is a lot.
 - Oh, what the fuck was that?
 Ew.
 (soft music)
 - That tastes like some insect poison.
 - You may be shocked to hear this,
 but believe it or not,
 we actually make the first one that you liked a lot.
 And then this last one that tastes like a roach pesticide.
 - Ooh, I'm sorry.
 I'm not even gonna disrespect y'all for that one.
 - It's okay, it's okay.
 Let it fly, let it fly.
 Roast the sauce.
 Come for us.
 - Oh my gosh.
 Michelle, you better clear my schedule out
 'cause my stomach is doing backflips, splits.
 Y'all need to be on TV.
 This needs to be a part of the X Factor, Fear Factor.
 This is like something, like for real.
 No, this is really like a life-changing experience for me.
 I'm not lying.
 Like this is like a moment.
 Like I've never, I've been through a lot of crazy stuff.
 This was so traumatic in my own dining room.
 Like I feel like I could accomplish anything
 in the world right now.
 Damn, I'm about to see who else went to the end
 'cause I'm like, I feel like a warrior right now.
 - Well, look at you baptized by the fire
 of the Hot Ones gauntlet.
 And I think you and I would both agree,
 both better off for it.
 And look at you, Saweetie.
 There is no hot sauce that can ever stand in your way.
 Now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, possibly a camera B if you've set one up,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - So now that my neurons are being reconnected,
 I have Back To The Streets, Pretty Bitch Music,
 Icy University, somewhere near you,
 whether if it's on a phone, a website, Twitter.
 I'm an icy girl, I'm a warrior
 and I can do anything I put my mind to, okay?
 I know that's right.
 (clapping)
 - Good job, good job.
 - I could do anything.
 Like I could do whatever I want to do at this.
 I could fight an ogre.
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans checking in to say thank you so much
