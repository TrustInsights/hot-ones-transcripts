 (dramatic music)
 - Is it hot in here?
 It's hot in here.
 - It's a hot one.
 - Whew!
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by CL.
 She's a global pop music icon who's back
 with her long awaited debut studio album, Alpha,
 which is set to release on October 20th.
 And to hold you over,
 she has a new single aptly titled, "Spicy."
 She's got the sauce, we've got the sauce.
 CL, welcome to the show.
 - Yes, thank you for having me.
 - Thanks so much for coming in.
 And while we're on the topic of spicy,
 what's going through your head
 as we prepare for this gauntlet?
 Like, are you a fan of hot sauce?
 - Honestly, I'm not good with spicy food.
 Yeah, but I do love hot sauce.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 - So you just take a bite?
 - You just take a bite.
 - What a weird date.
 Also, eating on camera,
 I don't think I've ever done that before.
 - Whoa, we got the exclusives.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 It's good.
 - Alpha's produced under your self-managed venture,
 Very Cherry.
 And I'm curious, what sorts of freedoms,
 an example of a freedom that you think you had
 making this record that maybe you wouldn't have had
 releasing it under a more traditional record label?
 - I come from a very traditional K-pop system.
 And, you know, I've learned so much
 and that's how CL was created.
 So I'm very grateful for that.
 But, you know, I've been doing this for a while.
 So I wanted to have more freedom to explore
 and expand and learn more with CL,
 like creating the world for her.
 Was that spicy for you?
 - You know, not the first, you know, thankfully,
 you know, this would be a labor.
 This would be a labor for me if that first one hit.
 You know, to me, it's just kind of nice.
 And we work our way to a nice place.
 This next one, kind of a nice color.
 This is the Yellowbird Bliss and Vinegar.
 - Okay.
 - Let's try it out.
 - Let's try this.
 Why are you going for it?
 - You're kind of going for it.
 So I'm just trying to hang.
 So you get a lot of due credit for your stage shows
 and really shine as a performance artist.
 And you once said, "Dance is not a five, six, seven, eight
 to me, it's just how I meditate."
 If forced to choose, which CL music video
 do you think has the best choreography?
 - Ooh, for me, I love, I love the spicy performance
 that I did recently.
 And, you know, "Hello Bitches" with Paris and her team,
 like that really like created a new category for me.
 So yeah, those are my favorite.
 I can't, yeah, I shouldn't, but those are,
 those two are my favorite.
 - How does rapping on the comeback stage at Inkigayo
 with a parrot on your shoulder?
 - I can't believe you said Inkigayo right now.
 - I did, I did.
 - It's so weird to hear it from you here,
 but you love it, yes.
 - Rapping with a parrot on your shoulder,
 how does that complicate a live performance?
 - Oh wow, that one.
 Okay, also there were like swans everywhere and like,
 yeah, lots of, yeah, birds involved.
 It kept biting my hair.
 Yeah, it kept biting it and talking to me.
 It was interesting, but yeah, it was like,
 I would never, I don't know if I'll ever do that again,
 but it was a fun experience.
 The color looks more red than the others.
 - Yeah, it's a little more intense.
 - Yeah.
 I don't feel the spice yet.
 You know what?
 Be careful.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 - Be careful about that.
 So believe it or not, we cover fashion quite a bit
 for a chicken wing talk show
 hosted by a bald guy in his 30s,
 but for you, for you we have to.
 Someone who Vogue once described as catnip for photographers.
 And then in 2013, your OG girl group, 21,
 did a collaboration with Chrome Hearts,
 which now, almost 10 years later,
 that's like every rapper's favorite designer.
 How would you explain the aesthetic appeal of that brand
 to someone who wouldn't know Tom Ford from Tom Hanks?
 - Damn, I can't believe you know that, first of all.
 I bought my first piece actually in Hong Kong
 when I was 12.
 I was such a fan of it.
 So I went there by myself,
 didn't tell any of my family members
 and bought my first piece
 and had it on my special occasion
 and met Jessie Jo,
 who's the daughter of the Starks family
 and became really great friends.
 And we performed together when she was back in Korea
 and it was like a dream to me to collaborate,
 just making something,
 creating something new with my friend.
 So it became that, which was more fun.
 And I think it's awesome that it's a big thing now,
 but yeah, it's like,
 I'm a personal fan of the brand and have always been.
 - What's your all time favorite CL fashion moment?
 And then what would you say
 was your most regrettable red carpet look
 or wardrobe function?
 - Don't ask me that.
 Regrettable?
 And then you're gonna,
 everyone looking on my regrettable.
 Can I be really honest with you?
 - Please be honest with me.
 - I don't remember.
 - You remember.
 I know it's in,
 I know it's sitting there right now.
 - Not regrettable,
 but I was actually the first one
 to wear Gian Galliano Margiela dress
 as a Asian figure and pop star,
 whatever it is, musician.
 And it looked like it was like the life-saving tube.
 The arm part of it.
 - Like you were drowning in the ocean and they threw.
 - Yeah, there was a lot of memes after that.
 So not regrettable,
 but that was not what I was going for, for sure.
 (upbeat music)
 - So as we mentioned,
 your music videos,
 they're like a high art form.
 Do song concepts ever come to you first as visuals
 or is that always a secondary thought?
 - First of all,
 it's what I wanna talk about.
 And then it's a character I build.
 Once that message and who she is is created,
 everything that I wanna talk about comes
 and flows naturally.
 So that's the process of it.
 - And then I know that you relish the freedom
 of being a solo artist,
 but I'm curious,
 are there any musical tools that you picked up
 being in a mega famous girl group
 that still serve you today?
 - I think being able to work
 with three very different type of characters,
 like together as a group,
 I learned so much from them.
 Like, Holmes vocal is amazing
 and just learning how she talks even
 helps a lot just sonically.
 And you're just around that all the time.
 So just things like that,
 it's just naturally soaked into me
 and they are a part of me always.
 They will always be.
 Yeah.
 I am actually doing better than I thought I would.
 - You're doing great.
 This one is a little bit of a step up though.
 Right on cue.
 - I don't want.
 (laughing)
 (soft music)
 - Yeah.
 Damn, I had to say that right before this.
 - Right.
 No, it always happens.
 That always happens.
 - You know what is going on?
 - So.
 - What's in this thing?
 - So I'm right with you.
 This is a hot number five.
 One of the hotter fives that we've ever had.
 You have Scorpion,
 you have fire roasted bell pepper.
 It has kind of a Buffalo sauce to it,
 but I think it's that scorpion pepper
 that really dominates and kind of shines in this one.
 - Yeah.
 - But it's okay.
 See how while you cool down on that,
 we have recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So I'll pull up the picture on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Your song spicy features narration from John Malkovich.
 And it's clear from scrolling the page
 that you guys have known each other for years.
 It's an intriguing friendship.
 How did you guys become close?
 - So Pete Berg invited me to be a part of his movie,
 Mile 22.
 And he was my,
 he was the leader of the agency thing.
 I was the role I was supposed to play.
 I did play.
 And we just got along.
 Cause he comes from theater.
 And I connected to his story so much and he's my mentor.
 When I was making spicy,
 for some reason I just sent it to him
 and I just had the first verse.
 And he heard that and sent me a five minute monologue.
 And I had to, I chopped that up and made that intro.
 - It was like, yeah, the spicy sauce.
 - Yeah. - From Korea.
 - Yeah, I just freestyled it and sent me like voice note
 on, you know, iPhone voice note.
 And that's how it ended up being in the song.
 - Are you ready to move on to the back half?
 - Can I say no?
 The last one was really, it hit me.
 - It's jarring, right.
 - It spiced on me.
 - But nothing CL can't handle.
 Oh, going, you know, this is on your recommendation.
 - Yes, this is the Korean.
 I don't even know what that is, to be honest.
 - It's kind of like a yogurt or something.
 - It is, it is, but sweeter and smoother.
 - Refreshing.
 - Yes, it helps the spiciness.
 - I might keep this on the table.
 - Do it.
 There's another one called Cool Peace.
 And I don't think you guys had it here,
 but that one really works.
 - All right, well, I'll try to go deep into the catalog.
 - Yeah.
 - So I'm often spammed by fan groups online
 who are angling for whoever they support to be on the show.
 But nothing, and I mean nothing,
 compares to the size, scale, and organization of K-pop fans.
 What would you say distinguishes them
 from other stan groups elsewhere in the world?
 - It's always the simple things that I love, you know?
 'Cause when was the last time we actually wrote
 a handwritten letter to someone?
 And there's, you know, they do that.
 And yeah, those simple things are the best.
 - I came in today, I got two wedding invitations.
 - Oh, amazing.
 A fan wedding?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Oh, crazy!
 - Yeah.
 - I never got one of those.
 That's never-
 - Something to aspire to.
 - Wow.
 Damn.
 Thanks for the invite, guys.
 (soft music)
 - What is this?
 - This is like, there's scotch bonnet,
 you've got Trinidad Scorpion, you've got ghost pepper.
 So it's kind of like greatest hits of the super spicies.
 Story checks out.
 - No.
 How are you doing?
 - Well, you know, my guess is this episode
 falls in the season somewhere close
 to the launch of your album.
 I know, I know.
 But for me, and it's the first shoot of season 16.
 So I've had a couple of weeks off.
 So it's always tough to get back on that horse.
 Yeah.
 So I'm going through it just like you.
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 - Like, yeah.
 You know what?
 It's their choice.
 People choose to do this to themselves.
 - Right.
 - Yeah.
 - And you, yeah.
 Just like you today.
 - Yeah.
 That was my choice.
 Whew.
 Yes.
 Damn.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Well, wait till you try the next one.
 But before that, this reaction that we're having,
 it's kind of a lovely segue.
 So I'm curious, as somebody who's traversed the world,
 how does Korean spicy compare to other cuisines?
 Like, is there something unique
 about the heat in Korean cooking?
 - It's very spicy.
 At the same time, I can't really talk
 'cause it's like, there's a lot going on right now.
 - Yeah.
 - Like, I missed your questions.
 Am I like high right now?
 - You know what?
 - Maybe like, am I high up?
 - That's not--
 - I might be.
 - That's not an uncommon response.
 You know, like the endorphins that kind of kick.
 You get kind of a head high off of it.
 - 'Cause I really feel like I'm dreaming right now.
 I will not remember this tomorrow.
 - We're floating.
 We're just floating through it.
 And then I see these,
 I see these two hands Korean style hot dog chains
 kind of popping up all over the place now.
 What are your thoughts on the Korean corn dog?
 Overrated or underrated?
 - Oh my god.
 Have you tried those?
 - Yeah, yeah, I've had,
 I've gotten some funky corn dogs.
 - Which one have you tried?
 There's like--
 - Well, they have all these different kinds.
 They're like, they're deep frying it
 and then like sprinkling it with like the mustard
 on the outside and all that stuff.
 - I think it's great hangover food.
 And some people eat it for dessert.
 Did you know that?
 They have it as dessert with like sugar on it
 or cream or like cheese.
 There's different types, but I love them.
 Yeah.
 - Lots of innovation with the corn dog.
 Here, we innovate with the chicken wing.
 And speaking of, are you ready to move on to the next one?
 - I'm scared of that one.
 I've been, yeah.
 - You've been told, maybe you've been briefed
 by people that are like, watch out for Da Bomb.
 - I mean, yeah.
 It says itself, beyond insanity.
 Are you ready?
 - I'm ready if you're ready.
 - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 - What?
 (laughing)
 Stop.
 I think I took a big bite.
 - You did, you did.
 You took a big bite.
 - Ooh, what?
 Oh my God.
 - I know.
 I know, it's crazy.
 - Have you tried this before?
 - Cabrera is not.
 - Oh my God.
 - I know.
 - You warned me but.
 - I know.
 - Am I red?
 - No, you look great.
 You look great.
 It's a nice wing eight glow.
 Nice wing eight glow.
 - Damn, that is spicy.
 - Crazy.
 Is that the spiciest thing you've ever eaten?
 - Yes.
 - Officially.
 - Are you sure this is like,
 pepper or like it's like.
 - So, it's been described as battery acid.
 Guests have described it as poison before.
 - It is.
 - Yeah, like you almost like want to reject it or something.
 - I don't think you're supposed to put that on food.
 - No, I agree with you.
 I agree with you.
 - What?
 - Where would our show be?
 Where would our show be at without it?
 - I hate my team for,
 they were like so excited about this, me being here.
 - Yeah.
 Death stare.
 Death stare to the couch.
 - Oh my God.
 - Downright gleeful, I gotta say.
 - They're enjoying, oh my God.
 - Way too much.
 - You guys are enjoying this?
 - Way too much.
 They are enjoying it way too much.
 - I don't know what to do.
 - It's all right, it's all right.
 We're almost, we're almost to the finish line.
 Now I'll just kind of, I'll try to gas pedal it.
 I'll race to the finish line.
 - Am I crying?
 - You look great.
 You look great.
 But here's what I'll say,
 just be careful around your eyes.
 Cause that's sometimes a mistake people can make.
 You know?
 Just don't touch your eyes.
 Don't touch your eyes.
 - Son, I'm on a mission to learn how to say that's spicy
 in as many languages as I can through this show.
 How would you describe like what you just ate?
 - Baila!
 - What does that mean?
 - Spicy.
 Baila!
 - How are you feeling?
 - I'm dreaming.
 I'm floating.
 - It's all surreal.
 It's abstract.
 What a bizarre interview.
 - Oh my God.
 I will never forget this interview for sure.
 - This next one is Cranked.
 It's from our friends at Hellfire.
 As you can tell by the cover art.
 - You know, after that.
 - Right?
 How bad can it get?
 - I feel my face like swelling up.
 I feel it.
 - I'm almost like numbing.
 Maybe I'm like going down or something.
 - My lips are numb.
 Like to a point where I'm like calm now.
 You know?
 You know when you're like very angry, you become calm.
 - Yeah, well, all right.
 I'm just going to keep an eye out in case the table gets
 flipped or something.
 - Just kidding.
 Oh my God.
 Yes.
 - So during season two of the FX show, Dave,
 in your appearance, you go into this tinted black car
 and you put on an LED face mask.
 Is that just for the show or can you personally speak
 to the benefits of light therapy?
 - I'm pretty sure I can.
 You should have asked me that question a couple sauces ago.
 But yeah, do it.
 Yeah, let's take care of ourselves.
 That's all I can say right now.
 Like all the data is like numbed right now in my brain.
 But yes, I do that.
 And it's great when you travel and you know,
 what am I talking about?
 - It's going great.
 You're doing great, CL.
 And then you get assassinated in that Peter Berg directed
 action thriller, Mile 22.
 What are the mechanics of doing that perfect going limp
 and falling to the floor after taking a headshot?
 - Oh wow.
 You know, yes, we were giggling after it happened.
 And I was with John.
 And also like more than you think you are moving,
 the action needed to be bigger when I was filming that.
 - All right.
 - Okay.
 Last one.
 - The last one.
 This is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab because it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last one.
 You don't have to.
 - Okay.
 - If you don't want to.
 - No.
 - Whew.
 You know what?
 I know what the bomb tastes like now.
 Tastes like nail polish.
 - That's a first.
 And I think that's accurate.
 - Right?
 - Mm-hmm.
 - I mean, never tasted it before,
 but I think that's how it would taste.
 - But you know, see all the coconut palette
 that can find the coconut and then sauce number two
 can find the nail polish and sauce number eight.
 - Whew.
 You put a lot on it.
 - You know, I'm not trying to be a showman or anything.
 I think I just,
 I think I just got the shakes with the bottle.
 It happens to me a lot over here actually.
 You'd think I'd be better at this by now.
 - Oh my God.
 Okay.
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 Last one.
 That one is spicy too.
 - You know, as advertised, that's kind of the show,
 but you know what?
 But you know what?
 - What?
 - See, Al?
 Thankfully though,
 it is the last stop aboard the Scoville Express.
 And we want to close with an obsession
 that's close to your heart.
 You told Women's Weekly Singapore,
 "I love Disney.
 To be honest, my mother told me
 I used to love Dumbo and Bambi.
 She said I watched it 5,000 times.
 Now my playlist these days is Disney music."
 I know this puts you on the spot,
 but as a pop music icon,
 what to you is the single best Disney motion picture
 original soundtrack of all time?
 (clears throat)
 - Under the Sea.
 It always puts you in a happy mood.
 Under the Sea mood with Sebastian.
 - You got Ariel, the Little Mermaid.
 And let me tell you, CL,
 being under the sea, an ice cold sea,
 that would feel good right about now.
 But you know what, CL?
 You made it through the wings of death,
 taking them on, challenging yourself.
 The spiciest wings that you've ever eaten in your life,
 the spiciest food that you've ever had in your life.
 But you know what?
 You didn't quit.
 You marched forward.
 You stayed on top.
 And now there's nothing left to do, CL,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - I have my new single out, "Spicy,"
 and my album, "Alpha," October 20th.
 And I'm actually making kimchi powder, too.
 So I'm excited about that.
 I'm gonna send it to you guys so you could try, Sean.
 I will look forward to it.
 CL.
 (clapping)
 - Thank you so much.
 - Great job.
 - Thank you.
 I powered through this with you.
 Oh my God, I had so much fun.
 I don't remember some parts, but yeah.
 - Hope you made it through, in the dream state.
 - Yeah. - It's just in the dream state.
 (laughing)
 - Bella!
 Bella!
 (laughing)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 This is Sean Evans.
 I just wanted to say thank you so much
 for watching today's episode.
 And as you know, every season, it's out with the old
 and in with the new hot sauce lineup.
 And I know you've been watching this episode
 and wondering to yourself,
 I wonder if I would cry like that.
 Would I sweat?
 Would I scream?
 Well, now you can find out because the Hot Ones 10 pack
 is available at heatness.com.
 That's heatness.com to get your hands
 on the Hot Ones 10 pack.
 Remember with the last dab, you don't have to
 if you don't want to, keep milk on hand,
 keep ice cream at the ready.
 You can do this.
 (upbeat music)
 You
