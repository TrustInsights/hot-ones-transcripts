 - I wanna answer your question.
 (coughs)
 But the pepper's dancing on my tongue.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the show.
 - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 From First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Megan Thee Stallion.
 Megan Thee Stallion is a three-time Grammy Award winner,
 philanthropist, and soon-to-be restaurateur
 and franchise owner, with her new partnership
 with Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen, starting October 19th,
 featuring the limited edition release
 of the Megan Thee Stallion Hotty Sauce.
 Keep an eye out for that.
 Megan Thee Stallion, welcome to the show.
 - I'm here, I'm ready, and obviously I like hot stuff,
 so let's see if this is really a challenge.
 - Yeah, what is going through your head
 as you prepare to chow down today?
 - Okay, honestly, when I sat down, can I curse?
 - Yeah, yeah, let it fly, let it fly.
 - It's like a fucking werewolf boogie man.
 I don't know, this one is a volcano,
 so let's just see what it's giving.
 This one got like some radioactive shit on the front,
 so let's see.
 (dramatic music)
 I feel like Oc and Cage was hot as hell.
 - Going back in.
 - The nugget was good.
 - There we go.
 - Okay.
 That's fire.
 - And pleasant, right?
 - I could do this.
 - So with Halloween right around the corner,
 I think now's as good a time as any
 to talk about how your love of horror movies
 has permeated your art,
 from appearing on the "Adams Family 2" soundtrack
 to then conceptualizing your web series,
 your horror web series, "Hottie Ween."
 Do you have an all-time favorite horror film reference
 in one of your music videos?
 That shit has a couple Easter eggs.
 - It has a lot of 'em.
 My favorite would have to be the Freddy Krueger one.
 - The hand coming out of the--
 - Yeah, the hand coming out because we got to twist it
 and make it me and make it the long nails
 instead of the knives.
 But I just really like to be scared.
 You know what, it's probably 'cause I like to be surprised,
 I like to be thrilled, I like to feel like,
 "Oh my gosh, what's coming next?"
 And I feel like that's what I make my hotties feel like
 when they listen to my music.
 Or just me as a person, like,
 "Oh my god, what is she gonna do next?
 "What is her hair gonna be doing next?
 "What is her nails gonna be doing next?"
 You know, so I like to scare people.
 I like to surprise people,
 so maybe that's why I like horror so much.
 - What did you mean when you said we needed it
 for the culture and reference to "Human Centipede?"
 - "Human Centipede," when I was first watching it,
 I was like, "I know there ain't no way in hell
 "this movie about to be about people
 "mouth-tied to each other's ass."
 (laughing)
 But I feel like that was something to crack your skull up,
 and that was something that really blew my mind.
 And I'm like, "You know what, this is gonna push
 "the next person to come up with something
 "even more creepier and even more creepier
 "and even more out the box."
 So, you know, pat on the back, Megan, if you said that,
 'cause we did need that.
 (laughing)
 That one didn't feel like a hot sauce.
 I don't know what this tastes like.
 (laughing)
 But it does taste like a hot sauce.
 Oh, wait.
 - Hit me in the throat.
 - But it has a little bit.
 I think it heard it talking about you.
 - The sauce is like, "What you saying?"
 Heard you.
 But it doesn't taste like hot sauce.
 It just is hot.
 (laughing)
 - So as far as hip hop origin stories go,
 I think making your name off cyphers
 is one of the most unimpeachable ways
 to really earn your stripes.
 And in terms of the radio freestyle shows,
 you've really made your mark on everything
 from Sway's Five Fingers of Death to Fire in the Booth.
 Is there one of those in particular
 that you've built up to be an especially important
 notch in the belt for a real MC?
 - I feel like every time you get in front of anybody
 in rap, it's the real deal, and you gotta go in every time.
 When I first came out and I was doing cyphers
 in Houston and Dallas and all that,
 I was like, "If I get the opportunity to rap
 "in front of anybody, I'm gonna give it my all
 "because I don't know when it's gonna be the last time."
 So I always go in and treat it like
 this gonna be my first and last time doing it.
 So all of it is a rite of passage when you rap.
 I really like to rap.
 So if I get to rap, I'm gonna rap.
 And I'm gonna go hard every time.
 But you know, yeah, every time you gotta go hard.
 So it's all like a rite of passage to me.
 (upbeat music)
 - Hoss Sauce, he got a little hat on with a little feather.
 I feel like y'all tricking me.
 - Like it's not up to your level yet.
 - No, like what is this called?
 Hot ones or cold ones?
 - Whoa!
 (laughing)
 But maybe, maybe Megan, maybe we're lulling you
 into a false sense of security.
 - Right, I'm like, "Okay, y'all gotta be doing something
 "to me that's a game."
 - Psychological.
 - Yeah, like you tricking, it might pipe up
 at this bright color one right here.
 It's not giving me hot.
 - Well, just wait, just wait.
 - Feel like something on my nose.
 - So you're coming off a massive year,
 multiple Grammy wins, one of the albums of the year
 and good news and then listening to it,
 something that really stands out is the layering.
 How obsessive are you about sound mixing in the studio?
 - It takes me at least like 10 tries
 to get the song mixed perfectly.
 And even when I'm recording,
 I have to record it like five times
 so I can make sure I said it right and it felt good
 and you could hear everything correctly
 'cause I have a, apparently I have a thick accent.
 I don't hear it, but that's what people tell me.
 So I'm like, when I'm rapping, I'm like,
 "Okay, let me try to make sure I say this clear as possible
 "with my same twang, but so y'all can understand me."
 I'm in there with the engineer, like I'm like,
 "Okay, no, it has to sound like this."
 No, y'all change the beat.
 What y'all do to this?
 Turn this up, do this.
 So I'm very particular about how my things sound
 when they're all said and done.
 (upbeat music)
 What do you feel like?
 Is it hot?
 - You know, we've done hundreds of these episodes.
 So not everybody has that sort of like Texas,
 chilly baseline. - Maybe that's what it is.
 - You have like a good tolerance for it.
 - Good Southern mix.
 - But I'll also say this, I've sat across the table
 from many people who in the front half are like,
 "What's the deal?
 "Crank it up."
 And then it's a much different story later on down the line.
 - Okay, well, let's skip to the end.
 You should've took me this way.
 - We will see, we will see.
 So from merch collabs with Crunchyroll
 to modeling as Todoroki on magazine covers
 to saying that you'll pop out on a hoe like Pikachu
 on your song "Fantasy Pool Party,"
 your love of anime comes through in everything that you do.
 What is the best anime, in your opinion,
 to reach for when you need a laugh?
 - Mm, a laugh.
 Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
 Let's just talk about the anime that I'm finishing right now.
 Let's go.
 - I'm watching "Black Clover," and it's so good.
 And my favorite character on the show is Asta
 because this motherfucker is always screaming and hollering.
 Even if they in the middle of a fight,
 he'll just bust out with some goofy shit.
 But in the show, everybody has magic.
 Everybody born with magic.
 But for some reason, Asta was born with zero magic.
 So everybody's be picking on him like,
 "Oh, you ain't got no magic.
 "You ain't gonna be shit."
 And then he was like, "Yes, I am."
 He was just really going hard.
 But he doesn't have magic,
 but that's what makes him unique in the whole world.
 So anytime anybody try to fight him or whoop on him,
 they can't because he has anti-magic.
 So it cancels out everybody else's magic.
 So he really the coldest character in the show.
 And I just feel like I can relate to him
 and any of the other main characters in anime
 because a lot of people, they try to count you out
 when they feel like you ain't shit
 or you ain't got something yet.
 But you train and you train and you fight and you fight
 and you keep proving everybody wrong
 and you keep beating the odds.
 And I feel like that's the type of person I am.
 (gentle music)
 Reaper Pepper.
 That sound like, you about to kill my damn taste buds.
 - No problem.
 Or maybe.
 - No, it's funny.
 'Cause I felt like you want me to be like.
 - No, you know what?
 I don't want you to be, and you know,
 I know I can't tell you this anyway,
 but I just want you to be real.
 And I know Megan Thee Stallion's
 always gonna be real anyway.
 So that's all I would ask. - I'm gonna keep it real
 in the room. - Just keep it real.
 Just keep it real.
 No problem with that one though.
 - This one?
 - Yes.
 - It starts kicking in.
 - Yeah.
 - Okay.
 I did talk shit.
 I talked shit.
 - Sometimes they hear you, I think.
 - The Peppers was like, "Activate."
 (both laughing)
 She got us fucked up.
 Okay.
 - But you know what?
 While you work through that one,
 we have a recurring segment on our show,
 Megan Thee Stallion, called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull up the picture over here on the monitor.
 (Megan laughing)
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 - Is it mine?
 - Yeah, off of yours. - Oh, shit, okay.
 - You are, as Melina, Thee Stallion.
 - Yes, it is.
 - Do you have any hot girl tips for Mortal Kombat beginners
 and what draws you to the game?
 - Okay, boom.
 Mortal Kombat beginners,
 whichever one I'm supposed to look at,
 get on Google, pull up the cheat code.
 (both laughing)
 Not the cheat code, but pull up the cheat codes
 and pick one, remember it, and I promise you,
 it don't matter who you playing against,
 you ain't fucking them up with that one move.
 So that's really how I learned how to play.
 Melina was the first person I ever like,
 Googled the code for.
 (both laughing)
 And I be killing everybody with her,
 and I don't care how long you've been playing.
 But this is really like a sexy picture to me,
 because the makeup is just on point,
 the titties are on point,
 and then it's like the mouth is just like,
 "Mm, I will eat you."
 But it's still, (both laughing)
 but it's still fire.
 And the bob, come on, bob your up.
 It's cute.
 - Hell yeah.
 All right, up next.
 What do you think was special about the Butter remix
 with BTS that helped launch it to a Billboard number one?
 - I feel like what was special about it
 was the fact that we all really wanted to do it.
 And it was like a little trouble getting there.
 - Yeah.
 - But we got through it,
 and I feel like everybody was so excited about it.
 And I was so excited to meet them.
 They came to New York,
 they wanted to meet me.
 I was like, "Y'all wanna see me?"
 So we all went up to Rock Nation,
 and they came and they met Ford,
 and they gave us gifts,
 and it was just so cute.
 - They met the dogs.
 - Yes.
 - Of course. - He's here.
 - Really? - Yeah.
 He can't eat.
 - No, no, no, yeah, yeah.
 Gotta keep a distance from the table.
 - But he will eat it if he could.
 - All right, up next.
 What do you remember about working with snakes,
 including a 120-pound albino python
 on the WAP music video set?
 - Okay, so boom.
 Cardi was like, "Megan,
 "I really wanna do a scene with snakes."
 And I was like, "Cardi,
 "you wanna do a scene with some snakes?
 "Like some real life snakes?"
 And I'm like, "Y'all don't wanna just edit them in there?"
 She's like, "No, we gotta do it with real snakes."
 So I'm like, "Okay, if Cardi B says
 "she wanted me to lay down with some snakes,
 "I guess I got to lay down with the snakes."
 So we get there.
 I'm like, "All right, I gotta meet these snakes
 "before I jump in this damn pit."
 When we laid down, I had met a little friend,
 a little bestie, it was a little green snake.
 I don't know if y'all know,
 if y'all noticed that it was like one green snake.
 We was killing it the whole time
 'cause that was my little friend.
 But I met these snakes before we laid down
 and I felt like we was keeping the peace.
 And then the whole time I was laying there,
 Cardi's like, "Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan."
 And then the music was starting
 and we'd be like, "Yeah, beat it up, baby."
 (all laughing)
 Trying to be all sexy still, but we were scared as hell.
 These snakes was doing their own thing.
 And I was like, "Damn, you got me out here
 "in the fucking snake pit, Cardi.
 "If we get bit the fuck up,
 "this song better go number one."
 (all laughing)
 But it did, so it was great.
 - All right, Megan, you ready to move on here
 to the back half?
 - I'm actually scared because this one snuck up on me.
 So I don't know what the fuck Senor La Chuga
 about to do.
 (soft music)
 I ain't even gonna talk shit yet.
 It's not hot, but it's nasty.
 (all laughing)
 I don't like that.
 - So you're a rapper and also a student
 as we enter the Hot Nerd Fall Semester over here.
 - I'm graduating.
 - This semester, right?
 - Yes, December 11th.
 - Congratulations.
 On the topic of school, do you have a happiest memory
 from your time as a member of the Panther Doll Dancers,
 right?
 - Oh my God, yes, how do you know that?
 (all laughing)
 My happiest memory as a Panther Doll,
 I guess when I made the team,
 because I had tried out for the team my first year
 and I didn't make it.
 And when I tried out again, I did make it.
 So I was like, "Hell yeah."
 But I really built like a really good bond
 with a lot of those girls.
 And when I was first coming up,
 some of them was dancing for me on the road.
 So like we got to take it, you know,
 off the basketball court to stages
 and all the first stages I first ever performed on.
 So that's a good memory for me.
 - All right, Megan The Stallion.
 Are you ready to move on here?
 - Okay, because the last one,
 y'all tried to feed me lake water.
 So let's see.
 - See what we got on deck over here.
 - And how you say this?
 - The Lengua de Fuego.
 - Okay.
 This might be some shit.
 Oh, this smell hot.
 My nose burn, okay.
 (soft music)
 I feel like I keep anticipating it being hot.
 - Like maybe, you know,
 you're playing psychological games on yourself.
 In addition to your hard hitting dense
 with wordplay rap style,
 there's also a clear R&B influence from even
 on the latest project,
 your song Freaky Girls has the Adina Howard sample to it.
 And then even one of your first original songs,
 like a Stallion has a genuine sort of like a pony vibe to it.
 In the great R&B tradition of creating songs to make love to,
 what are the most essential ingredients to a freak anthem?
 - Okay.
 I wanna answer your question.
 But the pepper's dancing on my tongue.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the show.
 - Okay.
 Because it was kicking in five minutes later.
 Okay, you wanna know what is the ingredients
 to making a good sex song?
 That's what you say?
 Did you say love making?
 - I did, you know, I did.
 Yeah, yeah.
 - Okay, the good ingredients to a good love making song.
 First of all, you need to have that good baseline,
 that good drum pattern.
 So you could be on rhythm.
 You got to match the strokes to the drums.
 If you cannot match the stroke to the beat, it ain't heat.
 (laughing)
 But, and then like, you just gotta have somebody
 that can really sing, like not sing but sing.
 Because when somebody can sing,
 you know, you really feel it in your soul.
 So it's like, you can, ooh, whoa, you know, like the riffs.
 Like, you know when somebody say that,
 ooh, whoa, they really can't sing.
 (laughing)
 They about to sing, they about to sing.
 So yeah, you just gotta have that good voice
 and you gotta have that good baseline and drum pattern.
 - Notes taken.
 - Yes.
 - On paper, part of the record.
 Are you ready to move on here to the next sauce?
 This is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Beyond Insanity.
 You know this about to be hot
 because this label look homemade.
 - Right. (laughing)
 - They made this in their basement.
 - It's like very mixed tape sort of out of the garage.
 - Right, give them this, they gonna fuck this, they're fired.
 (laughing)
 I'm cooking up some hot shit in my basement,
 you don't even know.
 Yeah, this look like some underground shit.
 (laughing)
 Are you taking a small bite?
 - I'll go with wherever you go with it, you know.
 - Well, let's take a good bite.
 - All right.
 - All right.
 - I'm following you.
 - 'Cause I see you breaking shit in half,
 throwing it in the trash.
 (laughing)
 I don't like that.
 (laughing)
 - All right. - You ready?
 - I'm ready. - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 - That's why I was going with the half.
 - We gotta do it big.
 - Yeah, I know.
 (coughing)
 - This shit rattling my sinuses.
 - Yeah.
 (coughing)
 - That's that.
 - Yeah, that's that one.
 - I know, I know.
 You and me, same page on that one.
 I've done this for a long time, it never gets any easier.
 (inhaling)
 - The peppers was like activated.
 - But while you worked through that one.
 - She got us fucked in the back.
 (laughing)
 - As we've touched on a little bit today,
 you always proudly represent Houston, Texas.
 So what I wanna do is play a little game called
 hot girl shit or not hot girl shit,
 where I'll give you a few things that are unique to Houston
 and you just tell me if it's hot girl shit
 or not hot girl shit.
 - Ah, I cannot stand milk but.
 - An important storm, you know?
 Crush that water.
 The turkey leg hot.
 - Hot girl shit.
 So I moved out of Houston right when it opened.
 So I literally, when I pop in,
 I have to have somebody like just go sneak
 and grab it from me right quick.
 The turkey just be falling right off, boom.
 Why is this hot sauce like playing tag
 with like my tongue, my lips?
 - OG Ron C. Mixtapes.
 - Hot girl shit.
 Gotta be chopping that slop.
 - Being stuck in traffic on the 610.
 - Annoying girl shit.
 Hate that shit.
 I used to be going to the Galleria all the time,
 just get stuck.
 Cutest fuck in the car for hours.
 - All right Meg, how you feeling?
 - I feel like this should be illegal.
 I feel like it got a radioactive sign
 because this shit was made at Area 51 or some shit.
 This is some alien ass hot sauce.
 Whoever made this shit need to be in prison.
 This my boy that look like a boogeyman, werewolf.
 This shit say cranked, I'm scared.
 Yeah, you be quiet.
 - Okay.
 - 'Cause you a deceiver.
 - And I'll step on the gas.
 I'll step on the gas to bring us to the finish line here.
 - The only way I can do it is if we just keep going.
 - We are gonna go fast, we're gonna go fast.
 So despite your high energy dancing on stage,
 you stay committed to live vocals.
 Do you have a lesson about breath control
 that you can maybe pass on to the aspiring pop stars
 who may be watching right now?
 - My mom definitely taught me
 take the breath at the right time.
 'Cause when I used to rap,
 I'll be trying to spit it all out at one time.
 (imitates drum roll)
 No, she's like, Megan, you need to catch your breath
 at the perfect word that worked for you.
 So yeah, that's what I do.
 - Well, that's great advice.
 All right, Megan, the stallion.
 (dramatic music)
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 - Well, you doing it, so I feel like-
 - Respect.
 - I'm just not gonna pussy out.
 Shit.
 Should I take the last dab?
 Yes!
 All right, girl.
 Why this shit all stuck up at the top like this?
 Oh, no!
 - It's a little wipe off, little wipe off on that.
 Going out with a bang.
 - Going out with a bang, a bang.
 - Cheers, Megan.
 What a ride.
 - This smell like it's about to hurt me.
 (laughing)
 (dramatic music)
 Mm-mm.
 - Right, right.
 Bringing it home, bringing it home.
 Megan the Stallion, mercifully,
 we've reached the conclusion of our meal together.
 And as your fans, the hotties know,
 there's many sides of Megan the Stallion.
 These stage names, the alter egos,
 the AKAs that you have on stage
 are not gonna make you jump through a bunch of hoops.
 Just gonna point to one simple hot sauce
 to bomb beyond insanity,
 and you tell me the first Megan the Stallion alter ego
 that comes to mind and why.
 - Hot girl, man.
 Spicy as fuck, hot as fuck, you can't take me.
 That's that.
 Light that shit up.
 - Mike Drop from Megan the Stallion,
 and look at you, taking on the wings of death,
 talking a little in the front half,
 having that returned a little bit in the second half,
 but making it through like an absolute champion.
 - You shaded me.
 - Look at you, Megan the Stallion.
 And now there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Oh my God.
 Let me gather my thoughts.
 Let me gather my taste buds, gather my composure.
 I told y'all we graduated December 11th,
 so that's the first thing I want to tell y'all.
 The second thing I want to tell y'all,
 my friend, it's only right that I gift you
 the hotty sauce that I have coming out with Popeyes.
 You are the first one with the official bottle.
 And this is not like this goddamn
 meth hot sauce that you got cooking up in here,
 but this some good shit.
 - I can't wait to try it, I can't wait to try it.
 - You're an official hot boy.
 - Oh, I'll take that.
 - Thank you for killing my tongue.
 - Collies, if you like cruelty, buy this.
 Oh God, I made it through.
 And you wouldn't have took me out
 if you wouldn't have gave me this goddamn dagger in a bottle.
 - You know what, I didn't take you out.
 I tried as hard as I could to take you out.
 I couldn't take you out.
 - Come on, 'cause you knew.
 - Yeah.
 - This was fun.
 - Bye.
 - Hot ones, truth or dab the game.
 The kit comes complete with 250 question cards.
 And then here's how the game works.
 You just go around the table, you take turns,
 be in the host, be in the players.
 And when you're a player and you get asked a question,
 you have a choice.
 Just like in the show, answer it honestly,
 or suffer the wrath of the last dab and take a look at this.
 There's even a mini bottle of the last dab included.
 I suggest you have napkins on hand.
 You have to have some milk on hand.
 And of course, be careful.
 Be very careful around the eyes.
 Hot ones, truth or dab, the play at home game
 is available at shop.firstwefeast.com,
 heatness.com and Amazon.
 Play at your own risk, wings not included.
