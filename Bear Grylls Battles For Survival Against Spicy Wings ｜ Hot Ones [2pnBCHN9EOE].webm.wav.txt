 (coughs)
 - Yeah.
 - Unusual that the first thing it hits from here
 is your eyeball.
 No, that's a bad sign.
 Wow.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Bear Grylls.
 He's an adventurer, best-selling author
 and the battle-tested host of a number of hit shows
 including Running Wild with Bear Grylls,
 which returns for its July 25th premiere
 on National Geographic.
 Today though, the man who's feasted his way
 through live scorpions and a yak's eyeball
 tries his hand at the wings of death.
 Bear Grylls, welcome to the show.
 - Hey, nice to be with you.
 Little apprehensive when they lifted that.
 That was like pow.
 - Oh, it cuts through the air.
 Yeah. - Yeah.
 - But don't psych yourself out just yet.
 I know that you're an adventurous eater.
 How are you around spicy food?
 - Probably not brilliant.
 This kind of similar dynamic that we have
 on Running Wild really.
 - Oh, a lot of ways. - In the sense that
 you know what you're doing.
 I'm the rookie.
 (laughing)
 A little apprehensive, but I'm ready to go.
 (dramatic music)
 Yeah.
 And look, we've got beef as well.
 - A hot one's first, just for you, Bear Grylls.
 - Thank you.
 I don't know, I love beef.
 Yeah, this is great.
 - This is new for me.
 - Mm.
 Yeah, I mean, this is how I eat.
 Good steak, a little bit of something hot,
 but I definitely hang around this side of the--
 - Not today, though.
 - Mm, that's so good.
 - So Running Wild isn't an interview show at its heart,
 but there's no denying that you get these very real moments
 with your celebrity guests that you'd never see
 on a late night talk show.
 How do you intellectualize how these extreme environments
 open people up and perhaps make them more relatable?
 - You look at a chat show, it's always a performance,
 isn't it?
 Somebody's got three minutes to be funny
 and tell a kind of great story or whatever.
 And I always struggle with that,
 'cause it never feels real, you know?
 And I think, as you know, you go out with someone,
 a buddy, and you hike a trail and, you know,
 get involved in nature and the outdoors for a bit,
 you have conversations that are much more real.
 And Running Wild's just an extreme version of that.
 You know, I think after you've faced a few fears
 and you've, you know, you've got a trust between each other,
 people open up.
 That's why I always say I think The Wild is the star
 of the show, really.
 Does my job for me.
 You're double lucky, yeah.
 (soft music)
 - Mm, so good.
 - That one's really good.
 The steak, the sort of tropical vibe with that.
 - Mm, well, my wife says, she goes,
 "You're gonna be terrible at that show.
 "You hate really spicy stuff."
 And I'm probably not great at really spicy stuff,
 but right here, it's dreamy.
 - It's very nice.
 You might be onto something here.
 - Note to self, don't wipe my eye or scratch my balls.
 Scratch your balls after you've been messing around
 with a da bomb.
 - Right, you might not live to tell the tale.
 - Yeah, it's game over.
 - So I understand that Will Ferrell legitimately struggled
 after eating a caribou's eye,
 and I've heard Deion Sanders tell his story
 of clinging to the Mesa Rock Wall a thousand feet up.
 When you think of the celebrities who've impressed you
 the most with the size of their adventure bug,
 is there a name that stands out?
 - You know, sometimes guests arrive
 and they want the whole nine yards.
 You know, they say, "Give it, give it all."
 And there's a little part of me that's always like,
 "Be careful what you wish for."
 'Cause the wild, again, tends to do it anyway.
 You know, somebody is, you know, it's unpredictable.
 You're gonna get some bad weather
 or the water level's higher than you expect.
 And you always gotta improvise a little bit.
 So, but Will Ferrell, I mean,
 I will always be indebted and love that man.
 You know, he was our first ever guest.
 We took him to the Arctic.
 You know, in those days, we'd go for days and days.
 You know, now it's much shorter and tighter.
 And, you know, we've learned otherwise,
 if you break people, you don't get anything
 out of them after a while.
 But Will, we didn't know that at this stage.
 So Will was in at the deep end.
 And still to this day, if I see him,
 he goes, "First of all, people still talk to you
 about that show."
 And secondly, he goes, "It was the hardest thing
 I've ever done in my life."
 And I go, "Will, you're a truly amazing man.
 On the shoulders of giants, we all stand.
 Will Ferrell is one of them for me."
 (gentle music)
 - Wow, somebody's put a lot of sauce on this one.
 This is like marinated.
 - We thought you wanted the whole 12 yards, you know?
 - Did I ever ask for the whole 12 yards in a hot one?
 Mm.
 Mm.
 Getting a little punchier, team.
 - This one.
 - So what you do, you lure it in with the first two,
 then cover the third.
 You guys are gonna have a slick pattern to this.
 - Yeah, lull you into a false sense of security,
 and then bring it.
 - Saving the milk.
 - There we go.
 So in 2019, Mountaineer Nirmal Persia posted a viral photo
 of a traffic jam of climbers at the top of Mount Everest.
 How does that photo compare to your memories
 of being one of the youngest people to climb the summit
 when you did it back in 1988?
 - Yeah, that photo was amazing.
 Nims is a good buddy of mine.
 He's an incredible high-student mountaineer.
 But you know, I think you gotta kind of roll with the times,
 and part of me thinks that's amazing.
 And people way younger and way older and without limbs,
 and I would never wanna take anything away from those guys
 'cause at the end of the day, you gotta climb it.
 The weather forecasting has got better,
 the gear has got better, and the oxygen has got way lighter.
 Why so many people would die is you're so slow,
 you're carrying so much weight.
 Those progressions are great,
 and I don't stand in the way of progress.
 So I look back on those times.
 Super lucky to have got the chance to do it,
 and grateful to have got away with my life
 where others hadn't at that stage,
 and ever grateful for the friendships
 with the guys I was with up there.
 This one's green as well, which makes me suspicious.
 Definitely getting into harder territory.
 Your eyes are watering!
 If your eyes are watering, I'm dead!
 No, man. (laughs)
 I'm trying to put up a calm front, you know?
 Thank you.
 Almost like you would do on your show, you know?
 I'm trying to be that support system.
 I loved it when Gordon,
 Gordon was such a good episode with you.
 Oh!
 So fun, wasn't it?
 Loving going, "You motherfucker!"
 (both laughing)
 We'll never forget that here in the studio.
 I always feel a much more boring guest, sorry.
 (both laughing)
 Off the top of your head
 without thinking about it too much,
 what would you say is the seminal
 or all-time greatest adventure novel?
 Huh, interesting.
 Unbroken.
 An incredible story.
 You know, the Louis Zamperini.
 They made it into a film which kind of lost so much really,
 'cause the book is insane, you know?
 He was an American soldier in the Second World War.
 His plane crashed in the Pacific,
 ended up in one of the longest survival
 life-or-death stories in history,
 whilst being strafed by Japanese enemy aircraft
 and shark attacks, and most of them died.
 A couple eventually made it,
 and you think you finally make it onto this island,
 but the island was one of the most horrific
 Japanese prisoner of war camps,
 and his journey was only just beginning,
 and he survived Nagasaki, nuclear bombs.
 I mean, you know, the transport ships from hell.
 You know, his story's amazing.
 He was broken in so many ways afterwards,
 but he found healing, and he found a faith in his life,
 and a great family, and he set up these amazing,
 you know, youth programs, and a true hero.
 (upbeat music)
 I'm breaking into the milk.
 We're halfway. (laughing)
 You know it's bad when there's the devil on horseback.
 We're at that point in the life.
 The grim reaper, yeah.
 They start threatening you through the marketing.
 Try not to get it on the lips.
 Smart.
 All right, Bear, in the meantime, though,
 we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 I love this quote of yours.
 "Life shouldn't be a journey to the grave
 with the intention of showing up
 in an attractive and well-preserved body."
 Do you have an injury or a scar
 that holds the most meaning to you?
 Yeah, but I got a private one.
 I'm gonna keep that one private.
 All right. (laughing)
 I think my back accident,
 breaking my back in three places
 was a life-changing journey for me.
 That free fall accident, jump went wrong.
 I spent the best part of a year in and out of army,
 rehabilitation, struggling to be able to reach a bathroom.
 It's just strapped up in braces.
 My back never lets me forget it.
 And I think the thing that's not letting me forget
 is that, number one, don't be an idiot.
 You only get it wrong once, be smart.
 And always be grateful for life,
 because there'd be so many times I should have died
 and I'm still going.
 So grateful for that.
 So many great things, whether it's sitting,
 eating crazy stuff with you or whatever.
 Life's a great privilege.
 And I think that's what the pain in the back
 always reminds me of every day.
 I'm really enjoying this.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, the clue is on the scale of how hot it is.
 There's a lot of chilies down the bottom there.
 (laughing)
 I'm hanging on in there.
 - I can see it.
 - Trying to pace myself.
 - The determination, I see it.
 - Come on, never give up.
 We're gonna get it.
 - The training, it's led to this moment.
 - What number are we on?
 - It's led to this moment, there.
 - The brain's going a little foggy.
 I'm in your hands, you'll guide me.
 - I got you, I've got you, I've got you.
 (laughing)
 - So besides obvious exceptions like David Attenborough,
 there aren't that many people who've been making television
 out in remote areas of the world long enough
 to see the effects of climate change.
 Are there obvious changes that you've noticed
 in your decades of doing expeditions that give you pause?
 - Climate change is undeniable.
 And the other thing about climate change
 is that it always affects the vulnerable,
 not just in terms of wildlife,
 which I've seen some horrific consequences
 of climate change upon animals and when you see 50 elephants
 fighting in a mud hole with so that much mud in it
 that for hundreds of years has been a full up
 and you see these elephants starving to death
 and so it's hard to come away unaffected.
 But the other side of it is that climate change
 affects vulnerable people, coastal communities,
 the poorest people in the world, rise in sea levels,
 extreme droughts, extreme rainfalls, flash floods,
 you know, and it's the one thing we all share together,
 the same planet, and I come from the position
 of if you love something, you protect it.
 And that's how I see climate change.
 Oh wow, I've just found the knife and fork.
 Yeah, yeah, here's to you.
 (laughing)
 Wow.
 Is the da bom worse?
 A lot worse.
 Yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
 (laughing)
 I appreciate the fact you're honest.
 I am, listen.
 I'm struggling a little bit with this one.
 (laughing)
 Come on bear.
 There we go, let's go bear.
 You got it, you got it bear.
 You've got it bear.
 Hand tight, save the milk.
 It's like anti-venom, you know.
 I've never heard this analogy before, but I'm all ears.
 Well, you know, we're in jungles all the time.
 A lot of snakes.
 In fact, one of our guys got bitten by a horrific snake
 and that's a whole 'nother story.
 I'll send you the photo of Steve's foot after that snake.
 Yeah, I gotta see Steve's foot.
 That's horrific, but this is Hot Ones anti-venom.
 That's taken me close to the wire team.
 Mm. Mm.
 Good. Here we go.
 There we go.
 The anti-venom.
 I'm really feeling the urge to scratch my balls.
 Don't.
 Don't.
 Okay, I appreciate it.
 Don't.
 I appreciate it, yeah.
 Like dive on that like secret service.
 From across the table.
 Okay.
 So there's a recurring question that we've asked before
 on Hot Ones to anyone who can give a credible answer.
 And I think that we can add you to the list
 alongside Padma Lakshmi and Andrew Zimmerman.
 Of all the animal testicles that you've eaten in your life,
 which ones do you think have the best shot
 at becoming a mainstream menu item
 if people gave them a chance?
 Well, first of all, none of them,
 'cause they're all pretty terrible.
 And there have been a few testicles over the years, you know?
 I mean, the worst testicle was the goat's testicle
 in the Sahara that this Berber tribesman had cut off.
 And I saw the goat before and it was quite a small goat.
 I thought, is it gonna be okay?
 Until I saw the size of the testicle.
 And I thought, that is out of all proportion.
 Anyway, I tried to eat this thing.
 Thought I'd try swallowing it,
 'cause I didn't wanna bite into this massive testicle.
 That was just gonna get ugly.
 So I tried to swallow this thing and it got halfway down,
 but it was too big.
 So then I threw it up.
 Now I have a mouth full of it and then bit down.
 So now I got testicle sacs, sperm and vomit in my mouth.
 You know, but I didn't wanna be rude.
 So I tried to hold it there.
 And then eventually kinda got it down.
 Yeah, that was a bad day.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 I'm suddenly getting a lot of kick from a buildup of eight.
 The cumulative effect.
 Yeah, I'm getting that.
 Well, wait till.
 And I haven't even done the.
 Wait till this happens.
 So once that bomb goes down, there's no going back.
 There's no going back.
 We're in it.
 Before we do that bomb,
 is there anything sensible you'd like to ask me?
 Because there's a potential the answers might get us slightly.
 Well, listen, I don't know if you've been following along
 so far, but nothing I ask is sensible, you know?
 Mm.
 Yeah.
 Unusual that the first thing it hits from here
 is your eyeball.
 Yeah, that's a bad sign.
 Wow.
 Mm.
 Mother love.
 Yeah. Wow.
 Yeah.
 Woo.
 Come on team.
 Never give up.
 Get the milk, get more milk ready.
 We should, yeah, maybe it's payback over life.
 So many, so many, so many guests we've had
 have been so many moments of kind of raw terror.
 This is payback.
 This is a long time coming.
 I'm gonna have a lot of running wild.
 Oh, buddy's watching this guy.
 You mother lover.
 This has been long overdue.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In all of your years of shooting,
 what would you say was the most inopportune time
 to experience diarrhea?
 Mm.
 Halfway up a rock face.
 Oh yeah?
 On a big cliff and I'd eaten a dodgy snake the day before.
 And wow.
 And anyway, I was halfway up this rock face
 and I felt it coming, you know.
 And as you know, when it comes, you can't,
 there's nowhere to hide.
 And I said to the camera guy, I said,
 look, turn the camera off.
 This ain't waiting for no one, you know.
 And so I had a hand up here on this thing,
 one hand on the rock,
 the other on trying to get my trousers down.
 Did the business into free air, you know.
 Crew underneath going, oh no.
 And I told him, turn the camera off.
 And they eventually got sorted and, you know,
 holding on and tied my trousers.
 Looked over there and there's a camera
 sort of blinking still, you know.
 There's nothing secret.
 Oh, wow.
 I know.
 No, but the other thing I've learned
 on this journey with you, respect.
 Respect for you, you know, good for you.
 I mean, you do this day in, day out.
 You know, I'm a de bombe virgin
 and it's probably gonna be a one-time relationship.
 You know, good for you, wow.
 Wow, and it doesn't get any better, does it?
 Double-bear, you got it.
 - Double-bear. - Yeah.
 - You got it.
 - What's the politically correct word for man up?
 - Step up. - Human up.
 - Yeah, human up. - Human up, come on bear.
 - And no fun, no fun at all.
 But after the last one, a little bit nicer.
 - Yeah, although that hurt the teeth.
 - Right, they kind of all,
 a whole lot different levels, yeah.
 - I mean, that's a new experience
 for something to hurt the teeth.
 You know, you'd never call that.
 No, if you're a viewer watching this at home,
 you think hot things, mouth, you know, lips.
 For something to hurt your teeth.
 - Different level.
 So I imagine there have been times in your life
 where fans will approach you on the street
 to tell you how something they saw you do on TV
 actually saved them in a potentially life-threatening,
 real-life situation.
 What is the story that stands out
 when you think about those stranded and lost stories
 that you've heard from fans over the years?
 - Hmm, well,
 oh, there'd be some good stories, you know.
 I don't know, I can't, you know,
 great ones are like snowballs getting lost
 and, you know, a few drinking urine.
 Ah, you know, kids falling through the ice.
 There'd be some pretty hardcore serious incidents of that,
 and then kids have been amazing and remembered something
 and, you know, fall through the ice.
 You're not gonna remember complicated, difficult things,
 but simple things like turn around
 and go back out the way you came,
 rather than panicking and trying to, you know, simple things.
 Rolling in the snow, you know,
 so snow can absorb the water off you.
 You know, obviously dry snow is gonna take the water away,
 so water ultimately, with wind chills,
 is gonna make you cold.
 So, great stories like that.
 I love hearing them.
 We get them the whole time, and never tire of it.
 So many heroes out there.
 Fuck, my mouth's so far.
 Wow.
 I'm not entirely sure where we go from here.
 - All right, so this is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing or the last steak.
 - Oh, lick my lips. - But today--
 - Such an error.
 Such an error licking the lips.
 - It's been such a day of firsts
 that I think we should do a first here on Wing 10
 with the dab.
 I understand that you've brought some snacks,
 and you're not the only one.
 We kinda had the same idea here.
 Ali, coming through from Bugable,
 you're not the only one with a bug plug over here.
 - Well, it's good, it's good.
 I mean, I was always taught
 never turn up for a party empty-handed.
 So, you're so kind, thank you.
 So I bought a little present for you.
 - Yeah, so we should--
 - I bought some maggots here, here we go.
 (laughing)
 Here you go.
 You got that?
 All these go 'cause he's the only one.
 - We got some worms over here.
 - So, what?
 There we go, so.
 - Yep. - You have the maggots.
 I'll have your worms.
 - I'll just do a little bit of both.
 - Guys, these are not, oh, they are worms, yeah.
 Yeah, like, well, they're grubs, you know.
 These look like these have been marinating something already.
 - Well, Ali seasons over here.
 (exhaling)
 - Oh, oh, fuck, that's not a dab.
 That's a marinade.
 - Yeah, yeah, be careful over there.
 - Hold on, let's go again on this, but that's a dab.
 - Here we go.
 Cheers, bear.
 - Hey, it's been a privilege.
 If we don't come out the other end of this experience--
 - It was all worth it.
 - It's been an honor, brother.
 It's been an honor, here we go.
 Here's to you.
 - To you.
 - Mm.
 (gentle music)
 - Woo.
 - Okay.
 (exhaling)
 - There's a reason you save it for the last.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - But we're there.
 - I don't imagine you have many recurring guests.
 - You know, we have a handful,
 but we probably have similar problems,
 similar things going on.
 - We're so funny, isn't it?
 It's true. - There's so much of it.
 Like, when I was reading your book,
 everything that I was, everything was like,
 I was like, yes, yes.
 I've never felt more seen
 than reading the same sort of challenges
 and then the same sort of effects
 that you guys have doing your show,
 where it does open people up.
 - Yeah.
 - You have this thing, celebrity,
 that is by definition unobtainable,
 but there's no artifice.
 There's nowhere to hide in the wild
 and there's nowhere to hide with the hot sauce.
 - Yeah, well, I love that.
 And you create connections, as you say.
 You go through kind of hot, scary things.
 You know, you're going to create some connections.
 But yeah, you do an amazing job.
 You know, wow, good for you.
 (laughs)
 But no, like you were saying,
 probably not many recurring guests.
 We have a few on Running Wild.
 - We have a few.
 - Channing Tatum's come back a couple of times,
 and a few others, but yeah,
 mostly it's like an experience.
 It's like Hot Ones.
 It's amazing, epic, but we're done.
 (laughs)
 Off the dab, we're done, you know.
 And it's a bit like that day two of Running Wild.
 They go, "Betis, this is epic.
 "It's been unbelievable.
 "Blow my mind."
 But we're out of here.
 - Never want to see you again.
 But you know what, Bear Grylls,
 we saw the challenge, we took it on,
 and we climbed to the summit of Mount Scoville,
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Oh, well, I have to ensure the thing
 to then plug the joke.
 You guys will figure it out.
 You'll figure it out.
 Hey, for me, more important than plugging anything,
 you know, it's just, I love it.
 It's been a privilege to do it with you.
 I'm honored you read the book, first of all.
 You're so kind.
 That'd be a good one to plug.
 Never give up.
 And Running Wild, Running Wild, that's why we're here.
 It's my brain fog.
 Running Wild, new season out now, amazing guest.
 Wow, that dad.
 Epic, such a pleasure.
 I would actually, I would class that as a household hazard.
 - Yeah, yeah, I think so, yeah.
 - You know, that goes along with bleach.
 You know, sulfuric acid, the machetes, the axes.
 - Da bomb. - That, you know.
 If you don't need it in your house, don't have it.
 Anyway, so fun, so fun.
 - Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
