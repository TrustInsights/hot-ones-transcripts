 (coughing)
 - I know.
 Might've been a mistake, but you know what?
 We're here, you know?
 (laughing)
 - All right.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter winks.
 And today we're joined by Cole Bennett.
 He's a music video director, hip hop taste maker,
 and the man behind the lyrical lemonade multimedia empire.
 Go check out his work with everyone from Eminem
 to Post Malone and many more
 on the lyrical lemonade YouTube page
 with its casual 20 million subscribers,
 of which I'm proud to say I am one.
 Cole Bennett, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you so much for having me.
 - How are you around spicy food?
 - Quite the introduction.
 - Oh, well you deserve it.
 - Thank you, sir.
 I'm like really bad with spicy food.
 I always thought, you know,
 one day if I ever do this interview,
 like how bad it will be for me.
 But I think that, I think I'll be good.
 I think I'll be good.
 (upbeat music)
 I'm ready.
 Okay, cool.
 I'm good.
 (upbeat music)
 Really good.
 Phenomenal.
 So I've always had an appreciation
 for the impact of music videos
 from the Hype Williams big budget days
 to that scrappy time when you'd see premieres on notright.com
 to you and what I would consider
 to be the most cohesive visual representation
 of today's young rappers.
 What role do you think that the music video plays
 in defining today's hip hop era?
 - I think music videos are really important
 because it pairs a visual experience with, you know,
 the song, the audio.
 And for me, I like to always make sure
 that the video comes out with the song.
 So your first time hearing that song is like this experience
 that you remember being attached to visually.
 And I feel like music videos connect you with an artist
 and, you know, they display their character
 and their personality and you can get fun
 and bring someone out of their typical world.
 And I think it's just, it's a moment, it's an experience.
 And yeah, I think it's super important.
 That one wasn't bad at all.
 I'm feeling like I could do this.
 - So like many creatives,
 I understand that your journey began by just doing,
 grabbing a camera and making videos,
 not necessarily drawing inspiration
 from any particular filmmaker,
 but if you'll humor me, what I want to do is bounce
 a series of quotes off of you from people
 who are widely considered to be some of the greatest
 rap music video directors ever.
 And I'm just curious your reaction to them
 and whether or not they ring true to you, okay?
 - Absolutely.
 - So this first one is from Director X.
 Anytime I disagree with the artist,
 when the project is done, I found the artist to be right,
 you know, within reason.
 - I absolutely agree with that.
 I agree with that because I'm often in the same situation
 where I think I have a really good idea
 and I might get a, you know,
 a little bit of pushback from the artist
 or maybe they may have an opposing idea,
 they want to tweak it a little bit.
 I think that's just like our creative engine going.
 But when we make these adjustments,
 we notice that it actually does benefit the project.
 And I think letting outside eyes in
 that are so attached to the project as well
 can be very beneficial.
 So I'd agree with that.
 - All right, up next from Hype Williams.
 Lighting helped me understand how I want to express myself.
 The more I worked on it, the more I realized
 I could control everything about what I was doing with color.
 - Absolutely.
 Lighting can impact video more than we realize.
 It can give so much feeling and texture
 that we would never think of, you know?
 - And then one more for you from Spike Jones.
 I love when me and my friends
 don't know how to make something.
 There's that risk of failure.
 If it's guaranteed not to fail,
 it's something you already know how to do.
 - You finished on a good one.
 It's the best one.
 I'd say everything I do is going into things
 not knowing how it's going to turn out
 and kind of shooting in the dark and hoping for the best.
 And I think that that pushes us, you know,
 and it pushes our creative boundaries
 to levels that can make us excel in many ways.
 Not too bad.
 Starting to feel like a champ.
 - Yeah, you look like a champ, champ.
 - I'm feeling like I can't be fazed.
 - So when Illumination Entertainment approached you
 to make a trailer for "Minions The Rise of Gru,"
 what in the world was the process like
 for getting executives on the level of Universal
 to sign off on an artist like Yeet for the project?
 It's quite the cultural win.
 - Man, it was quite the experience
 and a roller coaster to say the least, but yeah.
 So I had a few different artists lined up
 that were more PG and made more sense for this project.
 And then I remember we were on a Zoom.
 Something just dawned over me.
 And I was like, "Yeet is the guy for this."
 And I told him, I was like,
 "Look, I have something I'm gonna throw at you.
 It's not what you're expecting."
 You know, all of his music is, you know,
 centered around things that probably aren't fitting
 to this movie, but I want to bring in this artist
 and have him make a song specific to the movie.
 And I think it'd be a really just big moment
 for the underground, for the internet,
 and just for the movie as a whole.
 I think it's like the perfect storm and it's unexpected.
 And I think it just shakes things up.
 And I pitched it to him and I go,
 "Man, I really don't know.
 This is a big movie."
 Two days later, they had reached back and they're like,
 "You know, we thought about it and we talked to some people
 and we think it's genius."
 And I am happy with how it went.
 And it was really cool to see a trend kick off
 around this song and this moment
 that actually motivated people going to the theaters
 because what more could you ask for?
 So Illumination and Universal
 were very happy with that for sure.
 (gentle music)
 - Okay, cool.
 - It's good.
 - Going in.
 - I haven't eaten, well, I had pretzels.
 - And some butter.
 - A little half stick of butter.
 My girl told me it would coat my stomach well, so did that.
 But it's like my lunch.
 It's a good lunch.
 - So far, it's American.
 - Yeah.
 - Excuse me.
 - Your eyes are getting a little glossy.
 - Yeah, listen, you're walking me on this journey here.
 - I'm feeling quite confident.
 - I'm just along for the ride, Cole.
 - You're making me feel good about myself.
 (laughing)
 - So Lyrical Lemonade is a curator
 and constantly has its fingers on the pulse
 of the artists that are about to blow.
 I'm curious if you can articulate
 how you sift through the legions of internet rappers
 who to the untrained eye, to the untrained ear
 may seem homogenous.
 - I do what I'm into.
 I think there's been really, really beautiful opportunities
 that I've passed up on because it just didn't align
 with my morals and what I kind of thought
 the business model of Lyrical Lemonade was
 and just wasn't what I was listening to.
 And I think that there's times where I've taken a chance
 on artists that people would argue I shouldn't
 because I was into it.
 And I think it all comes from a place
 of just doing what I love and attacking it that way.
 And that's kind of like my mode
 and my approach to everything I do.
 If I'm into it, I do it.
 If not, then I'm okay on it.
 Yeah, it looks like a Shirley Temple in a bottle.
 Like a cherry cream soda.
 (laughing)
 - Let's see if it tastes like a cherry cream soda.
 - Looks like it might.
 - All right, Cole, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 And for you, we have a theme,
 Cole Bennett behind the scenes.
 All of the pictures are of you on set.
 And I'm curious, maybe you have a lasting memory
 from that shoot or what it was like
 to work with that artist.
 And we'll begin with the ensemble cast
 for your Godzilla video for Eminem.
 Side note, an MTV Video of the Year award nominee.
 - This video is like no other.
 You know, it's one of those things like growing up
 being a fan of hip hop music, music videos,
 and just pop culture.
 I mean, I remember Eminem as being the biggest thing
 in the world.
 So to get to work with him so closely and feel that energy
 and feel him be so ready to just log in all these hours
 and be so receptive to my ideas and my vision for things
 to a song that he had created was really, really cool.
 And this photo was actually in the hospital room.
 Mike Tyson was off shrooms.
 He offered me some shrooms,
 which was a bucket list moment for sure.
 But being on set and leading this vision
 was also a bucket list moment.
 So I had to pick my poison there.
 Didn't do the shrooms, but it was a great time.
 Dr. Dre was just a really cool dude.
 Before he left, he was like,
 "I really like how you led today
 and how you directed this vision,
 how you operated on set."
 And he grabbed my shoulder and he nodded his head
 and just looked at me for like 20 seconds
 and then grabbed my shoulder pretty tight
 and then just walked off.
 And it was a moment for sure.
 I'll never forget it.
 - Then this one finally from the set of your video
 for Justin Bieber's Honest.
 - Yeah.
 Justin is one of my closest friends
 and actually it's a funny story too.
 The AC in his trailer went out this day
 and he had sent me a song a week prior.
 That's how the whole "I Feel Funny" video came about.
 And I was like, "Yeah, let's just shoot that
 while we wait for the AC to be fixed."
 And we get everything ready to go on set.
 We just, you know, it was the kind of example of turning,
 you know, a negative into a positive.
 - Lemons into lemonade maybe.
 - There we are.
 Let me drink some lemonade.
 - There you go.
 - I like the design on this one.
 It's busy.
 A lot of text.
 I like text-centric designs.
 - Well, it's a big compliment from you.
 - Yeah.
 Let's drink.
 Maybe do one more thing.
 Ooh.
 - Yeah.
 - That's one of them ones, huh?
 - Greenish.
 Question for you real quick.
 - Of course, of course.
 - Oh my gosh.
 The DJ Khaled one?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Hilarious.
 - Classic, classic.
 - I actually don't even have a question.
 Just wanted to point that out.
 - Put the hinges in the fuckboy's hands.
 - Drop 'em in.
 Drop 'em in.
 - So a quote of yours that really resonates with me
 comes from a 2018 interview that you did with Complex
 where you said, "Eventually I'll be old
 "and not in tune with things.
 "I'm going to be an old dude
 "who people aren't going to look to for new music."
 Does that kind of perspective,
 does that make you more terrified about the future
 or is it actually kind of comforting?
 - I think it's comforting.
 - I do too.
 - We just need to be honest with ourselves
 and I think that you can only have your hand on
 the pulse of something for a finger on the pulse,
 finger on the pulse, finger on the pulse
 of something for so long.
 And I plan to graduate from this and get into other things
 and have new passions and explore new worlds
 and be the taste maker within that.
 And I'll always be within the space of music
 but I also have to understand that there's going to be
 people that come after me.
 And I want to inspire those generations
 and give them the tools to be able to do what I did
 and just like the people before me did for me.
 And that's the whole name of the game.
 I think people that try to hold on to something for too long
 get a little burnt out.
 So you gotta be honest with yourself
 and you gotta be honest with just how the game works.
 Harma Sauce.
 I don't know how I feel about that.
 - Yeah.
 We're in that part of the show.
 - Yeah, we're getting there.
 - But still going back in.
 - I'm a bad guy.
 (laughing)
 - So one of my ulterior motives in booking this interview
 is to ensure that I get a tour of Lyrical Lemonade HQ
 next time I'm home in Chicago.
 What's the holiest of holy grails on display
 in your nostalgia room?
 - So the nostalgia room is a room that I built
 that is like a place that anyone in the office can escape to
 and relax a little bit, get their mind off things,
 look around and
 have that nostalgic feeling,
 which I think is a feeling that brings us joy
 and creativity and calmness.
 Some of my favorite things in there in that room would be
 a lot of Simpson stuff.
 Got like an old Tupac toy.
 I'm gonna have toys.
 I keep them all in the package to just, you know,
 go and look at the dates that they released.
 And I love, oh my goodness, man.
 - I know, I know.
 - You know what, I like a lot of stuff in that room.
 - What's the most talent that you've ever had on the court
 at one time in the custom basketball court
 at Lyrical Lemonade HQ?
 - Oh man.
 You can imagine what Jack Harlow
 versus Max O'Cream looks like.
 That's my favorite moment.
 - And then you once said,
 I'll never understand why people have a problem
 with Birkenstocks.
 Can you detail what it is about Berks
 that makes it the perfect shoe for you?
 - Man, I once heard a quote about style.
 It says, "If you're comfortable, then you're stylish."
 I like being comfortable, therefore I'm stylish.
 That's why I wear Birkenstocks.
 Wow, I heard this next one is really bad.
 - Well, what you heard is true.
 Cole, I'm not gonna lie to you.
 This is the bomb beyond insanity.
 - We're just going to, that's it?
 - You know, I'm just, I'm on your schedule here.
 - I'm gonna just take a small bite out of this one.
 - Yeah, me too.
 That's all it takes.
 Well, not that small bite.
 - I didn't mean for it to be that big.
 - You know what?
 - Yeah.
 - I'm going for another bite.
 - Whoa.
 - You have to too.
 - I'm going with you then.
 - All right.
 Oh goodness.
 Respect.
 - I'm gonna do it, I gotta do it properly.
 - Yeah, you gotta.
 We're in it, we're in it.
 - We're super in it.
 - I know.
 - It might've been a mistake, but you know what?
 We're here, you know?
 - All right.
 - So there's a video on maxpreps.com
 showing off your highlights as a running back
 for the Plano High Reapers.
 What would you say is the crowning achievement
 of your Friday Night Lights career?
 Was it beating Sandwich High Indians 36 to seven
 in the 2013 IHSA playoffs?
 - You're crazy.
 - Man, can I pop over in that milk?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - I do it?
 Or I do it?
 - Yeah, go ahead.
 It's all you.
 And then just be careful, you know?
 Sometimes when people drink too much milk,
 that becomes like a worse problem than the hot sauce.
 - Water?
 - Yeah, baby.
 And then your hometown of Plano stood in
 for Smallville, Kansas in the superhero movie,
 "Man of Steel."
 Do you have any memories of the last son of Krypton's
 takeover of downtown?
 - Yeah, I do remember that.
 It was crazy.
 It took over downtown Plano.
 There was like fake decals on the windows,
 all this Smallville themed stuff.
 They did a casting call,
 so all my friends and I would try to get in the movie,
 get to send in headshots,
 do little interviews and such.
 And the big moment, I remember that.
 How you doing?
 I'm struggling.
 - I love to hear that.
 - It's a shared pain that we're going through.
 - 'Cause I'm hurting right now.
 - I know, I know.
 - Pucker butt?
 - Yeah.
 - I don't know if I like how that sounds.
 - Let's do it.
 - We got it, we got it.
 - We got this.
 - Still going in.
 - I gotta catch up.
 I feel like I didn't get a good nipple that first time.
 - Can you draw back the curtain
 on what it's like to have dinner at Diddy's house?
 Like can you paint the picture for me in my brain?
 - Yeah, so Diddy Face-taunts me one night
 and he's like pitching a few ideas,
 things we could work on.
 I was thrilled, of course.
 I was waiting for that moment, you know,
 just to get the Diddy cosine.
 And he's like, "When are you in LA next?"
 And I was like, "I'm actually in LA right now,
 but I go back to Chicago tomorrow."
 And he was like, "Look man,
 I don't want to put the puffy pressure on you,
 but why don't you stay another day and do dinner?"
 I forgot what we ate.
 It was good though.
 It was some sort of chicken.
 And he played me a lot of music,
 talked a lot of ideas, gave me a lot of game,
 spoke on a lot of history.
 Oh my goodness.
 He called me the, he looked at me, he laughed.
 He said, "Man, it's like you're like the white puff."
 (laughing)
 Oh shit.
 So yeah, I appreciate puff more than I can express.
 All right, Coles Bennett.
 (soft music)
 I wish we made it this far,
 might as well top it off great.
 There we go, yeah.
 The bomb, the bomb actually,
 it was here and it like worked,
 it works its way up your face.
 Like right now it's in my nose.
 Right.
 But like I feel it in my skin working up my face, it's crazy.
 How much you put on?
 I went a little crazy trying not to do this much,
 but it's hard to tell, you know,
 sometimes you just turn that off.
 I wanna match your energy.
 I said if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it proper.
 You do it proper all the time, I gotta back up.
 Salute.
 I'm not gonna lie, the bomb almost took me out.
 Yeah, we're still here.
 We're still, that's good, that's good, that's good.
 You gotta, you gotta put it on.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Here, here, here.
 Maybe that's like.
 Cheers, Cole.
 Cheers.
 I know.
 Yeah.
 You tell me about that.
 I mean, you're looking at me like it's my fault,
 but I feel like you wanted to take another bite of the bomb.
 You're like, you gotta match, you know,
 I feel like I should be giving you that look.
 Actually, I'm not gonna lie,
 felt way worse like immediately after the bite.
 Yep.
 But it's not as bad as you think.
 It settles in, hopefully it's not an eye
 of the storm situation, you know,
 where it comes back and builds,
 but don't worry 'cause there's a nice long lead
 on this question.
 You're like foreshadowing that.
 We've reached the end of our journey
 through the Hot Ones gauntlet,
 and to close things out,
 we're basically gonna squeeze whatever energy you have left
 while that brain soaks in hot sauce.
 And we can call this an unofficial list,
 but I am curious, the Cole Bennett, Mount Rushmore
 of Chicago rap music videos,
 the four most iconic Chicago rap music videos
 of all time in your opinion.
 That's a great question.
 Don't like, it could be don't like or love Sosa,
 you go either way.
 It's just twist a video, overnight celebrity.
 It's a video with Chance the Rapper called Family.
 And then for the fourth,
 we go through the wire.
 All right, well set it in stone.
 Cole Bennett's Mount Rushmore of Chicago rap music videos
 and look at you, walked in, not a hot sauce guy.
 You said you'd be horrible out here,
 but here you are taking extra bites of the bomb
 and drenching the last wing and the last dab.
 Now there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 I'm just enjoying myself.
 I'm really happy, I'm feeling creative,
 working on a few things, a lot of amazing projects.
 Not even gonna speak on 'em
 'cause I don't wanna sound like I'm plugging anything.
 Just know what's coming.
 It's gonna be powerful, impactful.
 And yeah, I'm excited.
 Life is good.
 (audience applauding)
 Thank you so much.
 (audience applauding)
 - Brutal.
 So cool to chat with you here, man.
 - Oh, thank you, man.
 What was your favorite sauce?
 - I fuck with pico rico.
 - Yeah, me too, that's like my favorite.
 - Yeah, pico rico's a great time.
 It's like.
 - Thank you.
 - Thank you so much.
 - No problem.
 - Yeah, you gave me a good one.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
