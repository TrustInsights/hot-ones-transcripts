 Am I gonna win some money if I eat all this?
 [laughing]
 What kind of money I'm gonna win?
 [dramatic music]
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Derek Lewis.
 He's a top contender in the UFC's heavyweight division
 and there's not a single fighter
 in the weight class's history
 with more knockouts on their resume.
 And he's celebrated for his sound bites
 almost as much as his power.
 Will he keep his pants on today?
 If the sauces get too hot, I guess only time will tell.
 Derek Lewis, welcome to the show.
 - Thanks for having me.
 See, that was pretty good.
 You did pretty good.
 You're way better than me.
 - I'll take that, I'll take that.
 And you know, Texas boys,
 they've traditionally done really well on this show.
 How are you around spicy stuff?
 - I love spicy food.
 My wife already knows that once I start eating spicy stuff,
 she already know to get the baby wipes ready.
 [laughing]
 There's gonna be some screaming in the bathroom,
 but I like it though.
 [dramatic music]
 It's already on there?
 - It's already on there.
 - Man, we should have switched place then.
 - Well, you want to switch?
 - Nah, it's all right, you already touched it.
 - There you go.
 So this one?
 - Yep, that one right there.
 We're always interested in how a fighter gets their start
 in this rose growing in the concrete profession of MMA.
 And then I know that you started off training as a boxer,
 but saw a faster, more direct route
 to making money through MMA.
 They're obviously both very hard ways to make a living,
 but what did you see as more difficult
 about the boxing journey?
 - Boxing journey, it's like,
 it seemed like you got to train a lot more.
 You got to do a lot more cardio and running
 and stuff like that.
 I'm not with all that.
 [laughing]
 No, with that.
 So MMA to me, it's like mostly like street fighting.
 So it's like you're doing everything you want
 instead of pulling hair and hitting in the nuts.
 So I'm done with that.
 - And then I oftentimes talk to fighters,
 especially early on about shady promoters or managers.
 What's a lesson about signing contracts
 or getting paid upfront that you had to learn the hard way?
 - I'm missing a lot of shady managers out there.
 And there's a lot of shady promoters.
 With some promoters, you got to watch in the contract
 that some of them only will pay you $1,
 then pay you cash afterwards.
 IRS don't like all that.
 So you got to be careful with that stuff like that.
 And there's a lot of promoters or managers out there as well
 that was trying to screw the fighter over
 and try to take all the sponsorship money
 and don't even tell the fighter
 that he's being sponsored by someone.
 Oh, they're probably talking about me.
 Sound like they're chiggling, right?
 (laughing)
 - Mike Tyson once put the art of the knockout into words
 by saying, "It's hitting them with punches they don't see."
 Does that ring true to you?
 And how would you define the art of the KO?
 - To me, it's like,
 especially knocking out another grown man,
 it's like one of the best feelings in the world.
 You ever did it before?
 - No, I don't know if you could tell that by looking at me.
 - It's a great feeling.
 I love it.
 It's addicting.
 - And then why did you say that your favorite
 striking technique is head kicks?
 - Head kicks is like something that I like to do
 to loosen up, get my nerves out.
 They never see it coming from a guy my size,
 so I like doing it.
 - And then what has been the most satisfying knockout
 of your career?
 - Most satisfying knockout of my career
 probably was against Curtis Blaze.
 Blaze been talking trash for three years straight.
 No matter if I win or lose, he'll be in my DMs
 or making public and knowing that he don't like me.
 Like my style or whatever, and so that was so sweet.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 That's good.
 You know, I think because you're like a Texas barbecue guy,
 there's like a little sort of like barbecue with that,
 with a little honey.
 It's kind of like a fall, October fest-y kind of sauce.
 - That's good.
 - So before being convinced to pursue a career in MMA,
 I understand that you worked as a tow truck driver.
 Obviously you're someone who can handle themselves
 in tense situations, but what is the most heated
 confrontation you've ever had with someone
 when you're towing their car away?
 - Probably the most heated thing it was
 because we also, with AAA, we also like pop locks.
 Like they lock the keys in the car.
 So I was like bending the glass back
 so I couldn't unlock the car.
 It was like a PT Cruiser drop top,
 and they thought I was going to break the glass,
 and I was just telling them, "Nah, I got this.
 "I know what I'm doing."
 And so they were just really like making sure
 everything is okay with their car.
 Like I said, nothing ain't wrong.
 This PT Cruiser, nothing ain't wrong with this thing.
 This thing's already broken before you brought it.
 And they said, "Oh, you being an asshole."
 I said, "Nah, I'm serious.
 "There's nothing wrong with the car.
 "I got this."
 Whenever I was tow truck driver,
 I really didn't care how I grabbed your car.
 So if you wasn't around watching me, I don't care how.
 I'm pretty sure your car was all messed up
 if you wasn't around, so.
 (laughing)
 Anything that got low-centered,
 I already know it's gonna be hot.
 - Hopefully we can--
 - I'm gonna grab your plate and you grab mine.
 - Well, you know, the rest, I'm open to that, by the way.
 I'm very, I'm open to the switcheroo if you wanna do that.
 You just let me know.
 - All right, I buy one and you buy one.
 - All right, well, let's alternate.
 - No, no, no, wait.
 (laughing)
 - So I've noticed that you're one of the few huge UFC draws
 that doesn't overly engage in petty trash talk.
 Is that just a coincidence or do you think you approach
 the fight game a little bit differently than the others?
 - I approach it differently.
 Most of them guys trying to be the best fighters
 in the world and stuff like that.
 I don't care about being the best fighter in the world.
 All I care about is the check.
 As long as they pay me good, I'm down to fight, whoever.
 - Is there a rule change that you'd like
 to see implemented?
 - I don't probably like the fight week
 doing all the interviews because most of the reporters
 keep asking the same question.
 Like, they all see the articles and stuff like that,
 but they still wanna get their turn
 to ask the same question.
 I hate doing it.
 - Yeah, this wing is kinda spicy.
 We can go on to the next one.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 That's good.
 This one and this one so far is pretty good.
 - All right, Derek, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 Which--
 - Not from our page, right?
 - From your page.
 And let me tell you, what a roller coaster that was.
 I don't know where you get your memes,
 but you have quite the collection.
 Are there any good follows that you can recommend
 for our viewers?
 - Of course Lil Duval, you gotta find Lil Duval.
 He's pretty funny.
 - Well, let's check out more of the conventional,
 more of the classic Derek Lewis pictures.
 We'll pull 'em up on the monitor.
 What's the best thing about being a Texans fan
 and what's the worst thing about being a Texans fan?
 - I guess the best thing is that they treat you good
 whenever you go to the games and stuff like that.
 Whenever we lose, a lot of guys get off the bandwagon.
 Saying that everybody need to be fired.
 But that's the only thing I don't like about it
 is just wishy-washy.
 - Yeah, but not you.
 - I'm not, no.
 - And then you threw out that first pitch
 at an Astros game.
 Listen.
 - Yeah, the wings are good.
 Yeah, so, yeah, well let's try this one.
 Yeah, what happened was I was wearing jeans
 as soon as I was getting ready to throw a mosquito bit me.
 Everybody knows mosquitoes are bad in Texas, so.
 - It'll throw that pitch off.
 Nothing to be ashamed of there.
 - Yeah, and there was a guy yesterday,
 playing at Yankees, I think it was,
 from Los Angeles, something, maybe.
 I seen on the top 10 this morning
 that he did the same type of pitch.
 So, you know, I could be a major league
 and it was just one mistake.
 - And then one last one for you.
 What do you remember about meeting Dave Chappelle
 at UFC 264?
 - Yeah, he's a cool dude.
 I thought he was taller than what he was.
 I thought he was taller than me,
 whenever I seen him on TV.
 And he loves his cigarettes.
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 Let me see, man.
 - Look at it. - Let me see.
 Let me see, so any color?
 - Actually, I think if anything, I got more color.
 (gentle music)
 - So back in 2018, you announced an open invite
 for people chirping you online,
 to come to the gym for a fight.
 Did you have anybody take you up on that offer?
 And if so, what were some of the highlights
 of the afternoon?
 - Oh, I had a couple of guys.
 And I knocked three guys out that week.
 So it was fun, it was fun.
 Made sure they signed the waivers,
 just like y'all had me do.
 Same type of paperwork, same.
 Signed the waivers and it was a lot of fun.
 It was a guy came on his birthday, 41 years old.
 I didn't care.
 He brought his wife and his daughter to the gym.
 His daughter and his wife was videoing.
 Knocked him out with a head kick in the first few seconds.
 His daughter started laughing.
 His wife said, "Ooh."
 And I said, "Let me see that video."
 And his wife said, "No, I already deleted it."
 But I seen a video from his daughter's phone
 and she sent it to the coach.
 And started watching us.
 "Oh yeah, that's what he get."
 I said, "It's his birthday."
 He said, "He didn't know we was doing kicking."
 I said, "What do you mean?
 He kicked me in my leg twice."
 He said, "Nah, we need to do that again."
 I said, "Nah man, it's your birthday."
 (laughing)
 Yeah, my coach didn't like that, though.
 He was worried that they was gonna sue him.
 (soft music)
 - Hey, that one's good.
 - Whoa.
 It's a pretty spicy sauce.
 When someone's like, "That's good,"
 with a poker face, I'm just.
 - No, it's good flavor to it.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - That's spicy, but it's good flavor.
 - So you're very vocal about your love
 for your hometown of Houston.
 Not the least of which when it comes to the food offerings.
 Do you have a go-to order at Mike's Seafood?
 - Anything you order at Mike's Seafood is good.
 Anything, I promise you.
 You go there, anything you order,
 don't matter what it is.
 I don't even like oysters.
 - But they're?
 - But they're.
 They smell better, but I done never tried 'em.
 They smell better.
 I'm sure they're good.
 I don't like oysters, but I'm sure they're good.
 - What is the Turkey Leg Hut?
 - It's a place, a restaurant,
 that serves big turkey legs that you grab the bone
 and the meat just fall off the bone.
 It's pretty good.
 They put all kinds of spices on it, like rice.
 I believe they do macaroni and cheese too.
 They put it on top of it.
 Lobster, I believe, and crawfish.
 They put it on top of the turkey leg.
 It's pretty good.
 You wanna drink water or no?
 - You know, it's okay.
 Yeah, I think I'll go in too.
 (dramatic music)
 - So this next one is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - Thing about with spicy food,
 you can't let it touch your lips.
 - Right, 'cause you get the burn.
 You get the burn. - The burn, the burn.
 That's what makes you wanna quit, but you know.
 - Not today.
 (dramatic music)
 - It's good.
 - Whoa.
 - Okay, now then again.
 (coughing)
 (dramatic music)
 Yeah.
 - That one's a little different.
 - Y'all did that on purpose on that one.
 (dramatic music)
 (gulping)
 - So like some wine, you know, you got swishing around.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 That one's crazy.
 That one's crazy.
 - I think it's making it worse now.
 - Yeah.
 So when we had T-Pain on the show, I know.
 Just chill for a second.
 (laughing)
 - This man talking about some T-Pain.
 You ain't hurting you?
 - No, it is, it is, it is.
 - All right, let's take our time for a second.
 - Sure, sure, let's slow it down.
 And then just be careful around your eyes.
 You know, if you sweat around your eyes,
 you'll wanna do that, but don't do that
 'cause you'll have spice on you.
 - Oh, y'all got an extra one.
 - Yeah, yeah, we have fully stocked Life Lines over there.
 (clearing throat)
 - But y'all ain't have the AC on though.
 - No, no, it's very hot in here actually.
 - Okay. - T-Pain, you say?
 - T-Pain, when he was on the show,
 he talked about the downside of owning luxury imports.
 What's the biggest pain in the ass thing
 about being a Lamborghini owner?
 - I guess right now because of COVID,
 the workshops in Italy is closed down right now.
 Am I gonna win some money if I eat all this?
 (laughing)
 What kind of money I'm gonna win?
 If I ain't gonna win no money, we could stop right now.
 - Dom, how much you got on ya?
 Dom, how much is in the wallet?
 - I'll tell you, it'd be two.
 (clearing throat)
 - What are your thoughts on electric or self-driving cars?
 Like, could you ever park a Tesla
 between two of your lifted trucks?
 - Yeah, I just brought a Model X.
 Yeah, I like electric cars.
 And I was looking into the Porsche Taycan.
 That was a pretty good too.
 So you mean to tell me
 these next two right here are hotter than that?
 - So here's what I'll say.
 Here's what I'll say.
 I think that if you can get past this sauce,
 you can get past any sauce in the world.
 This has been in our lineup since the beginning of time
 because it's such a show-stopping sauce.
 You know, you were cruising along, just no problem.
 No problem, no problem.
 The bomb, it's always just a hard road block.
 - And the dude over there, he probably like,
 yeah, we got his ass now.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, he just wait.
 - They've seen some shit.
 They've seen some shit in here.
 - I got big lips too, so.
 (laughing)
 I don't even know if you're supposed to put this
 on your lips, but.
 - Try it out.
 If it works.
 - So if I bump up tomorrow,
 y'all know who came for this.
 - That might've helped a little bit, actually.
 You might be onto something here.
 So in addition to excelling in contact sports,
 like MMA, obviously, and then football,
 which I know that you played in college,
 you also keep the competitive juices flowing
 with the occasional round of golf.
 What drew you to the sport,
 and then what's the part of your game
 that you think needs the most improvement?
 - What drew me to the golf sport?
 'Cause everyone always say that I'm rich,
 and so I said, okay, I'm something
 where rich people do, though.
 So I started playing golf.
 And I love it, I love golf.
 It's competitive, you know.
 Doesn't matter how long you've been golfing,
 everybody still sucks every now and then.
 So I feel right on in.
 - Do you have a 19th hole tradition?
 - Probably just take some shots, take shots afterwards.
 - There you go.
 - So what are you doing?
 - You don't have to, if you don't want to.
 - Yeah, I'm not.
 You probably was hailed in school, huh?
 Like the peer pressure and all that?
 - No, no.
 - You guys don't wanna try shrooms,
 and you're like, come on, man, you want?
 (laughing)
 - It'll be all right, they're not that strong.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 (laughing)
 - Hey, come on, man.
 You can't go wrong.
 - But.
 - They don't even taste like chicken.
 - But thankfully, Derek, we're out of the spice woods.
 That's it, that's it.
 And just one more question
 till we release you to a cryotherapy session.
 You've been a highly requested guest on Hot Ones
 ever since delivering that memorable post-fight soundbite,
 "My balls was hot."
 After taking on the wings of death today,
 can you describe in as much detail as possible
 what's going on through your mind and body?
 - I actually did want to take my shorts off,
 especially with that last two.
 But I ain't no type of shortest,
 I wasn't ready to RL.
 I didn't want to do anything like that though.
 But I can't even open my mouth.
 - Well, you know what, Derek,
 this show, it's whatever you want it to be.
 And today you took on the wings of death and conquered.
 And now Derek Lewis, there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Well, I opened up a beauty salon a few months ago,
 called Beauty Marks.
 We're gonna be opening up one,
 we're gonna try to open up one every year,
 every year until I retire.
 So that's the goal.
 And I also got a hot shot company going
 that's doing pretty good.
 I have a few trucks now.
 And everything's doing pretty good in my life right now.
 - Well, I'd like to hear that.
 (audience clapping)
 Great job, Derek, great job.
 (audience clapping)
 - I eat at a firehouse too,
 and they have house houses like this.
 - Yeah, do you ever go crazy like that?
 - Yeah, I tried a tin.
 - Yeah? - Yeah.
 - How does that compare to like this?
 - Oh, this is there.
 (Derek laughing)
 - Right.
 (Derek coughing)
 - What is up, camp fam?
 'Tis I, the Empire Guy Bill,
 for another heat in this Hot Ones unboxing video.
 Let's see what's inside.
 Ooh, a sticker, perfect for decorating one's coffin.
 (Derek laughing)
 And what's this?
 Hot Ones classic blue label.
 Garlic Fresno edition.
 Now with 10, ha ha ha, times more garlic.
 I can't do this.
 I can't do this.
 Can we cut?
 I can't do this.
 Do you see the problem with me doing this?
 Sound guy, do you see the problem?
 I'm a vampire and it's garlic.
 You can do this, Vampire Guy Bill.
 You can do this.
 Hey, that's delicious.
 Hot Ones classic garlic Fresno sauce.
 So good, even a vampire will try it.
 Only at heatonest.com.
