 - Happens.
 - Does it happen?
 - It does happen, it does happen.
 I'm usually like right on it.
 - Am I gonna--
 - But usually it's not like--
 - Am I gonna lose my eyesight?
 (bells jingling)
 (gentle music)
 - Hey, what's going on and happy holidays, Hot Ones fans.
 This is Sean Evans coming at you from the very cozy
 and very real Hot Ones fireside,
 and it's time for the spiciest annual tradition of them all,
 the Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza.
 Now if you know me, I'm a sentimental guy,
 especially during the holidays.
 I remember TGIF, the Family Matters Holiday Special,
 and bring a tear to my eyes.
 You know, just the other day I watched Home Alone,
 and then I watched Home Alone 2,
 just to get in the holiday spirit.
 So the idea that the Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza
 could be a part of your holiday tradition,
 it means the world to us here at the show,
 and all we ask in return, you know,
 in exchange for me eating da bomb like 40 times a year
 every year of basically my adult life,
 all we ask is that if you're capable, please,
 please consider a donation to our charity partner,
 Common Threads, as we work together to help them achieve
 their holiday fundraising goals.
 Common Threads is committed to providing children
 and families with hands-on cooking
 and nutrition education classes
 that strengthen communities
 by promoting healthy cooking, healthy eating,
 and the celebration of culture.
 To help us in supporting this amazing organization,
 all you need to do, click that donate button in this corner,
 or in that corner, but I'm pretty sure it's this corner.
 This corner right here, hit that donate button,
 help us support Common Threads.
 Last year, Gordon Ramsay busted out his Santa sack of tricks,
 and you guys busted open your wallets.
 We raised close to $150,000.
 Can we do that again this year?
 I hope so, but either way,
 we have a rollicking run of show for you
 from everyone here at the First We Feast family.
 Jesus Trejo is taste-testing classic holiday dishes
 with the kids of Common Threads.
 George, Nicole, and Alvin have got leftover sandwich hacks
 that even a kitchen dummy like me can pull off.
 Camera guy Bill is back in his holiday finery
 to present the second annual Hot Ones Awards.
 And to close things out,
 I know you peeped it in the thumbnail, baby.
 Will Ferrell is back for a second go-around
 with the wings of death.
 Stay tuned to find out if milk was a bad choice.
 But in the meantime, we head over to Los Angeles
 and tacos con todo host Jesus Trejo,
 who's hanging out with his young gang of budding food critics.
 Jesus, take it away.
 - Happy holidays, everybody.
 This is comedian Jesus Trejo.
 One of the things I love to do during the holiday season
 is a little three-letter word.
 Starts with an E, ends with a T.
 There's a little A in the middle.
 Eat!
 I love to eat.
 And here with me today to help me eat
 are some very special friends.
 (laughing)
 Are we shy?
 - A little.
 - A little, yeah, I get it.
 What is your name and where are you from?
 - My name is Omar and I'm from Cudahays.
 - Cudahays in the house.
 - My name is Emma and I'm nine years old.
 - Emma, nine years old, where are you from?
 From LA?
 - Yeah.
 - From LA, well welcome, Emma.
 Yeah.
 - Olivia from LA.
 - Olivia from LA, woo.
 - I'm Vincent, I'm 10 years old
 and I am from Atwater, Los Angeles.
 - Hey!
 And with that, we're gonna go try some amazing holiday foods
 from around the world.
 Let's go.
 (upbeat music)
 - Eggnog!
 - Eggnog!
 Oh my God!
 - What do you think this is?
 Tell me what you think as soon as you taste it,
 what does this remind you of to me?
 - It reminds me of a Cinnabon.
 - Ooh, if they start making Cinnabon smoothies, I'm there.
 Would you drink it like a cinnamon roll smoothie?
 (grunting)
 Oh, what happened, what happened?
 - The cinnamon went to my eye.
 - Oh no, are you okay?
 - I'm okay.
 - Okay, okay.
 - He's alive, he's alive!
 - That is so good.
 - Mooncakes!
 - You are looking at mooncakes.
 It's a Chinese pastry filled with sweets
 and it's super popular during the mid-autumn festival.
 Look, if you look at the full cookie,
 what do you think that is right there?
 - Full moon.
 - I see a blossom tree.
 - Blossom tree.
 - I kinda see a rabbit, a tree on the moon.
 - This outer part kinda feels like,
 it feels like dried up play dough, but tastes like bread.
 - I love the symbol!
 - You like the round shape, what it symbolizes?
 - Togetherness, you guys like being together?
 - Yeah.
 - Yes, high five.
 - Group hug!
 - Group hug, oh, group hug.
 My goodness, group hug, group hug.
 That fell apart really good,
 that was anything but togetherness right there.
 That was separateness.
 - Christmas pudding!
 - You guys wanna try it?
 - No.
 - All right.
 - No.
 - All right, three, two, one, get in there.
 - Oh my God, it tastes like.
 - You haven't tasted it.
 (laughing)
 - I did.
 - You're not gonna try it?
 - No.
 - Can you pass me a napkin?
 - Oh, yeah, we got a napkin right here, there you go.
 Anyone need a napkin?
 - It smells like raisins.
 - Actually, because it is made with raisins.
 Raisins and dried fruit.
 - Oh no.
 - Christmas pudding, you guys!
 - Doh-wah!
 - Huh?
 - Bontia!
 - What do you think it is?
 - A weird sandwich?
 - What you're looking at right now
 is an Ethiopian dish called dorowat.
 Basically, what this is, is a savory stew.
 The tortilla part of it that we were talking about,
 that's called injera, and basically what you do is,
 you open it up like a little gift.
 We don't need this.
 We're gonna put that right here,
 and you rip a little bit of this,
 and you go in, you slap it down.
 - Is this an avocado?
 - You basically pinch it.
 What's that?
 - Is this an avocado?
 - No, it's not an avocado, that's an egg.
 That's a hard-boiled egg.
 - It's very spicy.
 - It's very spicy.
 - Spicy.
 - Very spicy too, okay.
 If you hold it up to the light,
 you can see all the little holes.
 - Kinda tastes like mole, like the consistency.
 - The inside of it does look like mole, you're right.
 That's a good call.
 Fist bump, boom.
 - The little holes in the tortilla
 reminds me of SpongeBob.
 - Oh, they remind you of SpongeBob right there.
 - SpongeBob SquarePants.
 - On to the next!
 - Osachi!
 - What do you think is in this little box?
 - Orange chicken rice and my Amazon package.
 (laughing)
 - Your Amazon package.
 This next dish is eaten during New Years in Japan.
 You guys ready?
 - Yeah.
 - Three, two, one.
 Whoa!
 The different food items are meant to represent
 prosperity, good fortune, and health.
 - It's so fancy.
 - It's fancy, right?
 It's called a bento box.
 Who likes abalone?
 - What's abalone?
 - Never heard of it.
 - Yeah, me either.
 I said it pretty confidently, I don't know what abalone.
 - Abalone, that's why you know I haven't had it.
 'Cause I called it abalone and it's actually abalone.
 Let's make a promise that we're gonna try
 at least one thing in the bento box.
 - Okay.
 - Just one thing.
 What is the prettiest thing you see in there?
 - These, I forgot what they're called.
 - Oh, the salmon eggs.
 The salmon eggs, all right.
 What about you, Omar?
 - Shrimp.
 - Shrimp, that's a pretty stink, and you kissed it.
 - Try it naturally.
 - I give you props for trying it, that's really cool.
 - The mollusks!
 - These are strawberry and pineapple tamales.
 - Oh, I've had those before.
 - You've had them before?
 - Which is rich.
 - Have you had them before, Omar?
 - Nope.
 - Omar, talk to me, what's going on?
 - Yes, it's because I like regular tamales.
 - So what is a regular tamale?
 Can you describe it for me?
 - Chickeny.
 It's so smooth.
 - Or the chickeny flavor.
 Do you wanna try the pineapple one?
 - The pineapple one has raisins in it.
 - Pineapple has raisins, that's a great thing.
 - No.
 - Okay, tamales!
 - You guys, we got through that.
 How do you guys feel?
 Good, give yourselves a big round of applause.
 That was really cool, I really enjoyed eating with you guys.
 I really felt like we learned a lot about other cultures
 and how they celebrate the holiday season.
 Happy holidays!
 - Back to you, Sean!
 - RIP to Christmas pudding, but a huge shout out
 to Omar, Olivia, Vincent, and Emma Jesus.
 Looks like we might have some future standups on our hands.
 And again, if you would like to help these amazing kids
 and their families, again, please, please, please,
 if you're able, consider a donation to Common Threads.
 And with that out of the way, it is time to move on
 in the show where we check in with the first we feast
 hosts of The Burger Show, Burger Scholar Sessions,
 and Pizza Wars as they make the ultimate leftover sandwich.
 If there's anyone I can count on to bring in
 the holiday spirit, it is George Motes.
 George, what you got cooking over there?
 I feel like I can smell it from here.
 - Thanks, Sean.
 Happy holidays, everyone.
 As you know, I'm someone who loves tradition,
 but I love food.
 And in the Motes house,
 (scoffs)
 Hardest working button in the show business right here.
 And in the Motes household during the holidays,
 that means it's time for a very special leftover sandwich.
 We're gonna make a turkey hash sandwich.
 The turkey ass sandwich, dark meat.
 Dark meat is amazing 'cause it has flavor,
 tons of flavor in here.
 I love this sandwich.
 I love this sandwich.
 Okay, you ready to cook?
 Let's do this.
 This recipe actually comes from a good friend of mine
 and Michelin starred chef, Brad Farmery.
 So this is a sandwich with a pedigree.
 First, you start by making the hash.
 You gotta make the hash first.
 It takes a while.
 I'm not gonna lie to you.
 It might take a while,
 but it's absolutely worth it.
 Take the skin off the legs,
 pull the meat off the legs,
 and then braise it on a stove top
 for about 90 minutes in chicken stock.
 Little bit of soy sauce.
 I threw some thyme in there,
 which is really good also.
 You end up with this.
 This looks like pulled pork, right?
 Mm.
 Ooh!
 Mm, that's good.
 Oh.
 Whoa.
 What I'm gonna do is take some good crusty bread.
 Mm!
 And toast it up.
 I like leftovers because you're not wasting food.
 Do your part, people.
 Eat leftovers.
 Very important, mayo.
 Both sides.
 Put some turkey hash on there.
 First the hash.
 Mm, you've got mashed potatoes?
 Oh, green bean casserole?
 Sure, get some green in there.
 You had stuffing in your bird?
 Oh, how about that too?
 Mm.
 Gotta have gravy.
 Got a holiday leftover sandwich.
 Always gonna have a little bit of hot sauce in there.
 Give it a little kick in the pants.
 Don't forget the slice of canned cranberry.
 Mm, a little touch of sweetness.
 And look at that.
 Mm.
 Oh, it's supposed to be sloppy.
 It's okay.
 Oh, look at that.
 Mm.
 Oh, wow.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 Happy holidays to me.
 Don't forget to hit that donation button.
 Take it away, Alvin.
 Happy holidays, y'all.
 It's your boy, Alvin Kailan.
 And today we're making my favorite holiday leftover sandwich.
 We have crispy pata, King's Hawaiian bread,
 and everything else that we have in a Filipino refrigerator
 that's gonna make an ultimate yummy sandwich.
 So we're gonna start off with crispy pata,
 which is usually pork leg, sometimes pork knuckle.
 You see this like huge piece of skin.
 You gotta, you have to guard dearly with your life
 because you have that one uncle who will look at it
 and steal it off your plate if you're not looking.
 Shout out to you, Nestor.
 So I'm gonna throw this onto the griddle.
 Skin is re-crisped.
 We'll put this on the side.
 Add some cucumber, onions, chive, parsley, sugar,
 little bit of soy sauce.
 My favorite, calamansi juice.
 This is gonna add some twang, extra virgin olive oil,
 just to like amp up the unctuousness.
 Give it a nice mix.
 Oh yeah, look at this.
 We'll set this aside and then we'll start with our bread.
 So you wanna toast this until it's nice and brown.
 Pull this off.
 We're gonna melt some of this Edam cheese.
 They used to give this to us as gifts.
 And as a child, I really never appreciated it
 because who the hell wants cheese for Christmas?
 We'll throw our bread on top of that.
 Grab your plate, wham.
 Wow.
 We grabbed this beautiful crispy pata pulled pork.
 I can hear my mom in the background going,
 don't forget your vegetables.
 And there's the vegetables, mom.
 Remember that skin that uncle Nester did not take?
 We put it on top, wham.
 Look at that crispy pork pata sandwich.
 Ooh, mistletoe is back.
 This is so good.
 There it is, crispy pata sandwich.
 Parole, techno lights, I'm feeling all kinds of holidays.
 Nicole, take it away.
 - Thanks Albert and happy holidays everybody.
 In my house, when I think of holiday leftovers,
 it makes me think of one thing and one thing only,
 Jamaican corned beef and cabbage.
 For those who don't know, Jamaican corned beef and cabbage
 is also called bully beef and cabbage.
 And it's a staple in the Jamaican household.
 And you know what, it makes for an incredible
 leftover sandwich, especially on some Jamaican
 hard dough bread.
 And that's what we're gonna do today.
 Okay, so I'm gonna take my bread and the trick here is
 I'm gonna get killed by my mom, but you know, I'm greedy.
 I want the big slice of the bread.
 So I'm going straight for the middle.
 And look at that.
 See it's super dense, but it's also super soft.
 So traditionally all you need, corned beef and cabbage,
 hard dough bread, you're all set.
 But me, you know, I like to jazz things up
 a little differently.
 You know it goes good with mustard.
 And next, the star of the show,
 the Jamaican corned beef and cabbage.
 So when you couldn't get the real prime cuts of beef,
 you would get the corned beef in a can
 and you would make do with it.
 It's like a struggle food, but we no struggle no more
 because now instead of just putting one can,
 we put two cans.
 We took two cans.
 Mind blown.
 And the way that you make this is super easy.
 All you have to do is stew down some cabbage,
 some onions, you know, some peppers and tomato.
 When I smell this, I think of my childhood
 when my mother would make this.
 So I would just stand by, wait for my mother
 to move to the side and I'd snack some hot right out the pot.
 So now, need some Swiss cheese.
 So what's next on here?
 I'm gonna put some crunchy bacon down
 and then I'm gonna add some tomatoes.
 And then the last thing is the cool iceberg shredded lettuce.
 And then we're gonna top it.
 Booyah!
 What's up, wow.
 I'm gonna cut it right down the middle,
 just like they would do at Cat's Deli.
 You know what I'm saying?
 You know what I'm saying?
 Look at that baby right there.
 So the corned beef and cabbage is nice and juicy.
 We got the Swiss cheese, the ice cold lettuce,
 the bacon is slapping.
 All right guys, thanks for joining us.
 But most importantly,
 make sure you hit that donation button.
 It really counts.
 All right, that's it for me.
 Back to you, Sean.
 Wow, those sandwiches look delicious.
 To the culinary team at First We Feast,
 you guys never cease to amaze.
 The only thing that I ask is if you ask me
 to be on your shows in the coming years,
 maybe we can just eat like normal food.
 Not everything has to be spicy.
 George, sometimes I just want
 an Oklahoma fried onion burger, like without the last dab.
 Can I just have like a normal pizza?
 Does it have to be a spicy pizza?
 But anyways, I digress.
 You know, here on Hot Ones,
 we have a lot of Emmy Award winners,
 a lot of Grammy Award winners, Tony Award winners,
 Oscar Award winners,
 but do you know what's an even more exclusive club?
 The Hot Ones Award winners.
 And it is that time.
 I'm on pins and needles.
 And the only difference between our award show
 and the other ones,
 we don't have some Price Waterhouse Cooper audit
 for the selection process.
 It's just a lot of love and a lot of appreciation
 for the people who've taken on the Hot Ones gauntlet.
 And it is time to pass the reins over
 to our very illustrious host,
 camera guy Bill with the Hot Ones 2022 Awards.

 Thanks, Sean.
 Welcome one and all to the 2022 Hot Ones Award Show.
 I am so incredibly happy to be back hosting
 for what is sure to be an unforgettable show.
 It feels like we were just here
 celebrating last year's winners.
 Can you believe it?
 I sure can't.
 So much has happened.
 So many Hot Ones episodes, so many memes,
 and lots of cameras being operated.
 Wink.
 The Hot Ones Academy is back at it again.
 They've taken no days off.
 And here we are ready to crown
 the most award worthy moments of 2022.
 Let's get to our first award.
 You know what's harder than eating nine wings?
 Eating 10, and then still being asked
 to jump through one final hoop,
 even after the last ad begins to melt your brain
 and set your ton of blaze.
 When called to arms, these nominees rose to the challenge
 and they all deserve some recognition for that.
 Here are the nominees for this year's best wing 10 moment.
 Post Malone versus Sean Evans, Water Pond.
 Bear Grylls eating crickets and worms.
 Neil Patrick Harris' magic trick.
 And the winner is Bear Grylls.
 Congratulations Bear.
 - Hey guys, the Holiday Extravaganza best wing moment.
 What an honor.
 Thank you all so much.
 Sean, this was a really special one for me,
 you and your crew are such gems.
 So thank you.
 Have an amazing holiday.
 I've only just recovered.
 - Well, after a wing 10 moment like that,
 you sure deserve some hibernation time Bear.
 From the iconic Shaq face to look at us, look at us,
 who would have thought, not me.
 Hot Ones has launched a thousand memes
 because let's face it,
 seeing how celebrities handle themselves
 while eating some of the hottest sauces on the planet
 is always entertaining.
 With that in mind, here are the nominees
 for 2022's best reactions.
 Millie Bobby Brown.
 Daniel Kaluuya.
 Kid Cudi.
 And the winner is,
 Kid Cudi.
 Congrats Mr. Cudi.
 - Yo, I wanna say thank you so, so much for this award.
 I've been a fan of Hot Ones for a minute.
 You know, you guys have been seeing me on Twitter,
 talking about it.
 We've been planning this for a couple of years
 and you know, I just wanted to be memorable.
 Just wanted to have some funny moments,
 wanted to make you guys laugh.
 So here we are, I guess I did the job.
 Sean, holler at me.
 All right, we gotta do round two next.
 Switch up them sauces, all right?
 Give me a little test.
 Peace and love.
 - Wow, those sure were some reactions.
 While some guests spit in buckets
 and run laps around the table,
 others are stone cold killers
 who appear to be completely unaffected
 by the Scoville onslaught.
 This next award goes to the person
 who took on all 10 wings and didn't bat an eye.
 A true champion that deserves recognition
 for making it look easy.
 This was an incredibly tough category
 because we've had some true badasses in the Hot Ones seat.
 Here are the nominees for Wing Warrior.
 David Blaine.
 Lizzo.
 Courtney Cox.
 And the winner is,
 (drum roll)
 David Blaine!
 Congrats, Mr. Blaine!
 - This Hot Ones award is just so meaningful to me
 and as somebody that knows a little bit now
 about hot sauce, I mean.
 Mm.
 (thunder)
 (siren blaring)
 (siren blaring)
 - May I have your attention please?
 - Thank you, Hot Ones.
 - Wow, that sure was magical, Mr. Blaine!
 Every now and then, we have a guest
 who comes to the show and leaves a lasting impression
 on everyone, an infectious presence and personality
 that captivates the audience
 in ways we didn't know possible.
 Sometimes it's the way they tell a story,
 sometimes it's life advice,
 and other times it's overcoming da bomb.
 These are the nominees for the most inspiring.
 Queen Latifah.
 Viola Davis.
 Andrew Callahan.
 And the winner is,
 Viola Davis!
 Congrats, Ms. Davis!
 - I have been preparing for this award my entire life
 by sucking on bones, sucking the marrow out of bones,
 basically eating a lot of hot wings
 and chewing with my mouth open.
 So thank you, Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza 2022,
 most inspiring, thank you, Sean,
 for literally giving the best interview
 with the best chicken wings,
 and then I'm receiving this award
 for doing something that was just fun.
 So thank you.
 - Inspiring indeed, Ms. Davis!
 Keeping the inspiration going,
 it's time for the Hot Ones Lifetime Achievement Award.
 This award goes to a person
 who has given us so much quality content over the years.
 From giving Sean his first ever Carolina Reaper
 to the most Scoville-laced Hot Ones episode of all time,
 and who could forget that infamous horse and carriage ride
 through Central Park?
 This man is an international phenomenon
 when it comes to spice,
 and we at Hot Ones are so proud to know him.
 Your 2022 Hot Ones Lifetime Achievement recipient,
 Chili Klaus!
 - I'm overwhelmed.
 A lifetime achievement from you guys on Hot Ones.
 Thank you.
 And of course, thank you to my spice brother, Sean Evans.
 I love you, man.
 But maybe most important,
 thank you to all the spice lords from all over the world.
 10 years ago, no one cared about hot sauce or spicy food,
 and today we are millions.
 Cheers from Denmark,
 and of course, my Scandinavian cousins.
 - Well, there you have it, spice lords,
 another Hot Ones Awards in the books.
 This has been an absolute blast.
 Thank you to all our winners and nominees
 for giving us these great moments and for coming on our show.
 Oh wait, there's one final award.
 That's weird, 'cause I'm reading off the teleprompter.
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Holiday Spirit Award.
 I know who that goes to, and I think you do too.
 Spoiler alert, it's in the thumbnail.
 Ladies and gentlemen, back for round two
 versus the Wings of Death,
 our grand finale to the Holiday Extravaganza,
 the elf himself, Will Ferrell!
 (gentle music)
 - Hey, what's going on, and happy holidays, Hot Ones fans.
 It's that time, the culmination,
 the grand finale of our Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza,
 and I could not be more excited
 to once again be sitting across the table from Will Ferrell.
 For decades, he's been one of Hollywood's most prolific
 and enduring comedic actors,
 from the Saturday Night Live stage
 to movies like Anchorman, Elf, Stepbrothers,
 and many, many more.
 And on that note, you can catch him
 starring alongside Ryan Reynolds
 in the Christmas-themed musical comedy Spirited,
 which is currently streaming on Apple TV+.
 Will Ferrell, welcome back to the show.
 - Thank you so much.
 I love the little elf hats you put on here.
 - Just for you, the red carpet treatment,
 whenever you come back. - Amazing, amazing.
 - What's going through your head
 as you prepare to take on the gauntlet a second time?
 - I think it's a little bit like childbirth.
 The first time I did the show, labor was terrible.
 I was like, never gonna do it again.
 But then the feedback was so amazing,
 this beautiful baby of feedback.
 And I didn't remember the pain anymore.
 And now I'm back here to make another baby with you.
 - Let's make a baby, Will, let's make a baby.
 - Was that a good analogy?
 Was that a good approximation?
 - Yeah. - Thread the needle.
 - Yeah, yeah. - You thread the needle
 right there, Will.
 And one last time, if you're able,
 please consider a donation to Common Threads.
 It means the world to us here at Hot Ones
 for the kids and the families.
 Will, are you ready to go?
 - I'm ready. - Another round?
 - Ready.
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 - Oh, chili maple.
 You throw in the maple just to kinda lull you into
 that it's gonna be okay.
 - A little sweet heat.
 (gentle music)
 - Mm.
 It's good.
 The chili and the maple.
 - So your latest movie, "Spirited,"
 has some huge musical moments,
 including my personal favorite,
 which is based entirely around the idea
 that telling someone good afternoon
 was the equivalent to telling them to F off
 in Dickens-era London.
 - Yes.
 - What stands out when you think about
 the behind-the-scenes mechanics
 that went into the film's particularly ambitious
 song and dance numbers?
 - "Good Afternoon" is a great example
 where it all came from Sean Anders, our director,
 who was studying the classic version of "Christmas Carol,"
 which I think was shot in the 1940s or '30s.
 And he was remembering how everyone in that movie,
 if they said, "Good afternoon,"
 it was as if it was like,
 "How, what did he just say to me?
 "Oh my goodness. (gasps)
 And it was the Dickensian version of F you.
 And we thought, "Oh, we should do a whole song
 just based off of that phrase, 'Good afternoon,'
 and that it's this horrible thing we're saying,
 and yet it's a release for my character
 to kind of let off some steam.
 - Are you ready to move on here to wing number two?
 - Wing number two. - You're doing so good.
 So this one is the barbacoa here in the two spot.
 - What is a barbacoa?
 Is that like a chupacabra?
 - Yeah, I think so.
 It's a chupacabra.
 - Yeah.
 - Urban legend, deep woods.
 - The barbacoa. - Yeah, coyote high dog.
 - Stalks you at night,
 and then breathes its hot sauce breath on you.
 - Yeah, that's where it comes from.
 (gentle music)
 - So far, so good.
 Maybe I've gotten tougher.
 - So as I'm used to read that you actually worked
 as a mall Santa before your career in comedy took off,
 can you give us one highlight and one low light
 of being a Pasadena Plaza Kris Kringle?
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, I did that in my starving actor days.
 I was Santa and Kris Katan.
 - Was an elf?
 - Was my elf.
 Kris Katan from Saturday Night Live
 and we did Night of the Rocks bear together.
 It was fun 'cause we would walk into J. Crew
 and I'd be like, hello J. Crew.
 Merry Christmas.
 How are the button downs doing?
 And they got so used to it, they'd be like, hi Santa.
 Like folding shirts.
 Do you have a houndstooth jacket anywhere?
 No, it's in the back Santa.
 Like they were so over us.
 And we also learned that no one was there
 to monitor our break times.
 So we would take like five minutes every hour.
 By the time, I mean, we'd work for 10 minutes
 and take 50 minutes off and just sit here.
 - And then are you counting work harassing the crew
 is at J. Crew?
 Are you counting that as work?
 - Oh yeah, that's on the clock.
 That's on the clock.
 But the worst and best moment was we encountered this,
 these two kids came up to us to say hi
 and it was right out of the cosmetic store Origins.
 They had this little sculpture of like a coyote
 in front of the store.
 And we're saying hello to these kids and we look up
 and it's Kevin Costner, there's a parent with them.
 And it's Kevin Costner with a hat.
 He's being very incognito and we're like,
 hello, what's your name?
 Oh, Merry, what do you want?
 Oh, you've been a good little boy and girl.
 Hi Santa, hi.
 And Kevin Costner, he's just kind of looking at us.
 And they're crawling on this coyote.
 And I was like, oh, do you like crawling
 on that little coyote sculpture?
 And then Chris can't help himself.
 It's like, it looks like you're dancing on the coyote.
 In fact, it looks like you're dancing with wolves.
 And Kevin Costner goes like, let's go, let's go.
 Like don't blow my cover.
 He's like, okay, come on kids, let's go, let's go.
 I'm like, what are you doing?
 He's like, I couldn't help it in his elf voice.
 (laughing)
 So that was like good and bad.
 Really proud of myself so far.
 Oh yeah.
 - You can already tell.
 - I can already smell it.
 I smell the heat coming up.
 - And then these are really good wings.
 They're kind of falling off the bone,
 but that was one of those bites where it like,
 it all fell off together.
 - Yes, I felt like I just ate.
 Yes.
 - That entire wing, like in one bite.
 So it's kind of leaves a little trail behind it.
 - That is a jump up.
 (laughing)
 - We're taking exponential leaps here.
 - Yeah.
 - So last time you were on the show,
 we talked about the influence that sports has,
 not only in your work, but throughout your life.
 As someone who once held the single season
 field goal record at Irvine's University High School,
 what is your take on the plight of the kicker?
 Like, do you think that it's an underappreciated position
 in art form?
 - It's definitely an art form.
 I think, yeah, kickers will always be
 the butt of many a joke on a football team.
 Because, and I lived it.
 I didn't have to run laps.
 I didn't have to tackle anyone or be tackled.
 And yet I could win a game.
 And so it's a pretty good gig.
 You don't have to worry about head trauma.
 (laughing)
 You can just run out there.
 You don't even have to wear the pads in your pants.
 (laughing)
 Unless they're gonna eliminate field goals and extra points.
 - You gotta give kickers a little more respect.
 - Exactly.
 - And then I noticed that you're wearing
 the Kings hoodie today.
 And when I saw you at the Kings game last year,
 you had your Kings chain.
 I could tell immediately that I was dealing
 with just a seasoned sports event professional.
 Do you have an all time favorite
 Will Ferrell Jumbotron moment?
 - Well, there is a video that I shot
 that they play every time I'm at the game.
 And then they inevitably cut to me.
 And something happened last year where,
 usually I just wave,
 but now I mimic the video on the jump.
 So I'm there screaming, go Kings, go!
 But I incorporate a karate chop
 so that I do go Kings, go!
 Go, go!
 But I'm screaming, I don't know why I'm screaming
 'cause no one can hear me.
 I'm in a big stadium.
 But that gets a really good reaction.
 - That gets the place going.
 - Yeah, gets the place going.
 - Gets the people going.
 - Gets the people going.
 No one knows what it means.
 It gets the people going.
 (dramatic music)
 Beyond insanity.
 I remember it.
 I have nightmares about it.
 Cleansing breath.
 Yeah, deep cleansing breath.
 If you chew it really fast, does it?
 - No, I don't think that there's any hack.
 I don't think that there's any trick.
 It's just, you're there.
 And since we bit at the same time,
 it's now hitting for me, I imagine, across the table.
 - Engage mucus membrane.
 As the snot flows down my...
 Yeah. - Yeah, no fun.
 Never get used to this one.
 So when you first joined the cast at SNL,
 why was it important for you
 to embrace the opportunity of small roles?
 Like I've heard you talk about getting big reactions
 off of just like screaming beach volleyball off camera.
 - Yeah.
 Well...
 I have a little milk.
 - Yeah, yeah, I'll join you.
 - All right, yeah.
 Yeah, I realized...
 I mean, I love being on "Saturday Night Live" because...
 (laughing)
 It was my favorite show,
 but also being a part of an ensemble.
 I just loved it.
 I made a point to tell the writers,
 like, I don't care, cast me in a super small part
 because some cast members took offense to that.
 And I just made a point to say,
 I'll deliver a pizza in the scene, you know,
 if you need someone, just 'cause it's supportive,
 but it's also just an opportunity
 to potentially get a laugh.
 God, serve me well.
 - And then it's a trope of ours to ask SNL alum
 about things going sideways during the live tape.
 Besides flubbing literally the first lines
 that you ever had on the show,
 what's been your most memorable break?
 Careful, careful.
 - Yeah.
 - Saw that one tear just going.
 - Yeah.
 One, there was a great break.
 There was a character I had done on a weekend update.
 He suffered from a disease called voice immodulation.
 Oh shoot, I might've gotten something in my eye.
 - I was so worried about that.
 I was so worried about that.
 - I'm not a doctor.
 Okay.
 - Happens.
 - Does it happen?
 - It does happen.
 It does happen.
 I'm usually like right on it.
 - Am I gonna,
 - But usually it's not like,
 - Am I gonna lose my eyesight?
 - No, no, you're gonna be okay.
 You're gonna be okay.
 You had this little cross pollination.
 Like you probably took your fingers on the cloth
 and then took that cloth and basically bear maced yourself.
 - This, I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed
 while I tell this story.
 I started doing this character
 and the glasses I was wearing fogged up so much
 that I couldn't see the cue cards.
 And so that just started making me laugh so hard
 that I totally broke.
 When Tina and Jimmy were like,
 "Jacob, are you okay?"
 But I speak like this the whole time.
 And so it was insanity.
 - All right, well.
 - Oh, I think we're back.
 Do I look like a prize fighter or something?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Just right after you just went 12 rounds.
 You just went 12 rounds.
 - MMA guy.
 - Well, this is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab
 'cause the tradition around here
 is to put a little extra on the last wing.
 If you're having too many things going on over there,
 you don't have to.
 - Oh, I'm not gonna wuss out.
 - There we go.
 - Can't really see to open it.
 - It's like the sketch all over again.
 - It is.
 Oh, goodness.
 - Oh, okay, careful, careful, careful.
 - I'm just gonna rub that off, actually.
 - Yeah, there you go.
 All right, cheers, Will.
 - Cheers.
 - All right, Will Ferrell.
 - Okay.
 I got the tag of the...
 Oh, these are from Utopia Kitchen.
 - Yeah. - Great.
 - And you now have the proud distinction
 of taking on the wings of death on two separate occasions,
 reigning victorious, and in a time like this,
 that's all about reflection.
 All about being grateful.
 All about giving thanks.
 I think we need to officially acknowledge
 your contribution to the art form,
 to those of us here at Hot Ones.
 I wanna present you with the final award.
 Thank you, Dom.
 - Oh, wow. - The final award
 of the day. - Look at this.
 From what I can see.
 It's the Hot Ones Spirit Award.
 - This is amazing.
 - And it's all yours.
 You can put it right next to your Mark Twain on the mantle.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - The floor is yours.
 - Well, I just wanna thank everyone here at Hot Wings.
 Hot Ones, sorry.
 Hot Ones.
 I feel like
 we've really become a family
 in these 12 minutes or so I've been here.
 And you know, every morning,
 I'm gonna put this by my bedside,
 and every morning when I wake up,
 I'm gonna look at it with my one good eye.
 And remember the friendship and the warmth,
 the literal warmth. - Yeah, the heat.
 - The heat that you and your show have shown me.
 So thank you so much.
 - Thank you.
 - This is the greatest award I will ever receive.
 (laughing)
 - All right, thank you so much, Will.
 Happy holidays. - Happy holidays.
 - Congrats again. - Thank you.
 Good to see y'all.
 Catch you at the next King's Game.
 - Yeah.
 - Well, there you have it.
 It's another Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza in the books.
 Will, we're wishing you a very speedy recovery on that eye,
 and to you watching at home, we wish you happy holidays.
 You know, this is one of our favorite shoots of the year.
 Dom, our producer Dom, it's her favorite shoot of the year.
 And I think it's because we get to spend
 this special time with you guys
 during this very special time.
 So thank you so much for watching.
 If you were able to donate to Common Threads
 and one last time, I'll point it out in the corner,
 donate Common Threads, Common Threads, Common Threads.
 Thank you so, so much.
 And from our family over here at Hot Ones
 to yours watching at home,
 we wish you a very happy holiday.
