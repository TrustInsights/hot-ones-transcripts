 (groans)
 But you're doing so good.
 - What's wrong with you?
 - What are you doing?
 I don't know, I don't know.
 (groans)
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Anna Kendrick.
 She's an Academy, Emmy, and Tony Award nominated actress
 whose resume includes everything
 from acclaimed Broadway performances,
 beloved indie films, and record shattering movie franchises.
 Her latest project though is the psychological thriller
 Alice Darling, which is currently and exclusively
 in AMC theaters nationwide.
 Anna Kendrick, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you so much for having me.
 I'm in an excellent mood right now
 and things are gonna go so bad later on.
 - I love, I love the positivity already.
 But you know, I remember we had like a dinner thing last year
 and you told me-- - A normal dinner.
 - Normal dinner, and you told me, you go,
 "I will never ever do your show."
 - I did say that.
 - But here we are just a few months later.
 You're in the seat, I'm curious what changed
 and how are you with spicy food before we start?
 - Someone has a gun to my head just off camera.
 That's the only reason I'm here.
 I'm not sure exactly, but I mean,
 I think the show is wonderful.
 I love watching the show and I have often thought,
 "Oh, if they didn't have to eat all those wings,
 "I would love to go in that show."
 But I'm not a person who's good with spice,
 never have been, so I'm happy that anybody's watching this
 just 'cause they wanna see me get tortured.
 I'm in a great mood about it.
 (dramatic music)
 - This seems like the darkest one,
 so is that like a psych out thing?
 - Yeah, not an indication. - 'Cause I would've assumed
 that this one would be the spiciest.
 Not an indication. - Not an indication.
 - Nobody's safe. - Yeah, right.
 - Can't judge a wing by its cover, as they say.
 - It's nice.
 - See?
 - Enjoy this 'cause I'm gonna have
 such a bad attitude later on.
 Oh my God.
 - So your latest project, Alice Darling,
 tells the story of a woman nearing
 her psychological breaking point
 as her untenable and abusive relationship
 bubbles to the surface during a weekend getaway
 with her friends.
 And I don't mean this to sound backhanded,
 but I'm so used to seeing you in a movie
 and immediately falling in love with your character.
 What did you see as the challenge,
 or maybe even the opportunity,
 in playing a character like Alice,
 who's a little less sort of immediately endearing?
 - Yeah, immediately endearing.
 Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.
 I'm gonna steal that.
 I hope you don't mind.
 Yeah, I think I am much more comfortable,
 or I guess I just usually get hired
 to play characters where I'm supposed to try
 to be endearing, charismatic, charming, funny,
 you know, something.
 There's something that you like about the character.
 And the idea of playing a character
 who is kind of a bummer,
 just not that fun to be around
 and see if it works as a performance
 and if people will stick around
 to end up rooting for Alice.
 Because I think it's important
 that the movie starts with you not really clear
 on who's the good guy and who's the bad guy,
 because there were times in your life
 where you're not sure, like, am I the good guy?
 Am I the bad guy?
 And that's sort of like the,
 it's almost like a mystery film,
 where you're unfolding what's actually happening
 to this person.
 (gentle music)
 Oh, that's nice.
 - So not to get too meta while you eat
 scorching hot chicken wings on a talk show,
 but I really think of you as like a true patient zero
 in this new press era of celebrities
 who are asked to do a whole lot more
 than just answer questions.
 What is on a degree of difficulty,
 like the most challenging hoop
 you've been asked to jump through?
 - Okay, two things.
 The time that I,
 I think a bunch of people might have asked
 if I would do the cup thing,
 like while I was promoting the first "Pitch Perfect" movie.
 And I never did it,
 and because I knew that I wanted to save it
 in case Letterman wanted it,
 because everyone is afraid of Letterman.
 Like you kind of save your best stories for him,
 'cause he's like intimidating, right?
 But the hardest thing I ever did
 was on a British radio show,
 where I called, I was with Promoting Trolls,
 and I was with Justin Timberlake,
 and we had to call toy stores.
 And every, wait, okay.
 See, even describing it,
 it was every sentence that I said
 had to start with the next letter of the alphabet,
 'cause it's so hard, but it seems so simple
 that you'll feel really stupid if you don't do it.
 So I was really stressed out about it.
 I think I was hoping that Justin was gonna say no to it,
 and then he did it, and I was like,
 you son of a bitch, you know, I've gotta do it.
 So yeah, that like haunts my dreams, that one.
 Okay, here's what I will say.
 So far, although I suspect we're gonna get out of this soon,
 I can actually still appreciate some flavor
 without just being like, I do not like this feeling.
 But I think we're, you know,
 heading in the wrong direction,
 but like, this tastes really good.
 - But you know, you came in here kind of terrified.
 I can see it kind of like, look at you,
 going in, taking extra bites, dropping the shoulders.
 - Mm, yeah, I'm trying to breathe slowly.
 (sighs)
 - Sir, the deep cuts are, I mean, I shouldn't be surprised,
 but yeah, so that is a theater
 where I started doing community theater.
 I think the, this is embarrassing
 because I wish it was something cooler,
 but the very first show I ever did,
 the very first like music acting anything I ever did,
 I was like six or something.
 Annie was the first thing I was ever in,
 and I was one of the little orphans,
 but I had a lot of energy,
 and I do remember the director telling all the girls
 to stop playing with the dog that played Sandy,
 and he was like, just go like, play with Anna.
 She has too much energy anyway.
 Just like, I don't know, like take her for a walk,
 for God's sakes, so she'll calm down.
 - How about the Victoria Mansion tour,
 overrated or underrated?
 - Oh, um. (laughs)
 This is crazy.
 The Victoria Mansion tour, I think is pretty fun.
 I mean, I don't know, if you're from somewhere
 that has cool shit, maybe you're gonna be like,
 it's just a house, it's just like a nice old house.
 My dad passed recently, and he had a collection
 of Christmas ornaments that are from like a local jeweler.
 They do every year, like a Portland landmark,
 and I know that me and my brother are gonna end up
 fighting over the Victoria Mansion one,
 'cause that's kind of like the OG one.
 The Victoria Mansion is the thing in our city
 that makes us feel classy.
 Okay, number four.
 Oh God.
 (grunts)
 - Oh, it hit.
 - Oh, whoa.
 Whoa.
 Did I get something bad?
 (laughs)
 - Is it true that you asked for an additional take,
 something that you rarely do on the set of Get a Job
 because you weren't satisfied with your bong rip?
 - Oh wow, that's really interesting.
 I never put this together.
 I did the same thing on Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
 about a bong rip.
 - Oh.
 - Yeah. - Yeah, you got it.
 - I forgot, yeah.
 The scene where me and Aubrey Plaza
 in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
 are sitting on the couch, and there was like,
 just this joke where I'm supposed to like,
 take a big rip off the bong and then say a line.
 And I remember the director, and I just couldn't like,
 'cause it's not real weed, it behaves weirdly.
 And I couldn't get like the perfect pull
 and then blow and the line right.
 Like it wasn't really singing.
 And he was like, "It's okay,
 "we've got a lot of coverage on this."
 And I was like, "I know you're gonna want to use this
 "in the two shot, I know you are."
 And he was like, "I mean, you're right,
 "I do want to use it in the two shot."
 So that was the other time that I was like,
 "Come on, coach, give me one more.
 "Give me one more."
 (laughing)
 Okay.
 I'm doing that thing that all the guests do
 where they're like, "It's not that bad."
 Oh God.
 - Right.
 Oh.
 (laughing)
 But going back in.
 - I'm trying.
 - Immersing yourself in the experience.
 Love it, love to see it.
 - Oh, yep, okay.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Don't freak out.
 - Don't freak out, don't freak out.
 - Yeah, Sean, don't freak out.
 (laughing)
 Why are you freaking out?
 - You're doing great.
 You're doing great.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Fact or fiction, many of the actors who were fired
 on Up in the Air weren't actually actors,
 but real life people who were recently laid off
 and then instructed to react as if they wish they would've.
 - Yeah, that's exactly right.
 There were a bunch of people,
 and at first I remember that idea sounding
 like a little wonky, and it turned out so well.
 Although I did actually feel bad for Zach Galifianakis
 because it's like when people start singing in a musical
 the first time, even if you like musicals,
 it's like, oh, right now this is happening.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - And yeah, I did feel slightly bad for Zach Galifianakis
 for having to kind of start the acting phase of the movie
 after all this really raw, intense emotion.
 - I gotta keep up with you.
 - The going for the extra bite feels like,
 now I gotta do this, but then even just licking my thumb,
 then I go, why?
 You didn't have to do that.
 - You know, different types of guests come in here
 and react different ways.
 An athlete, you can almost see they're like,
 just one more rep kind of thing in them,
 but with actors, sometimes they actually eat more,
 and I think it's to immerse themselves
 in the experience more or something.
 - I wonder if it's because a lot of actors
 genuinely have a pet peeve about scenes
 where no one really eats anything.
 There's a scene in "The Bodyguard"
 where Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner
 are having a drink at Barney's Beanery,
 and he is holding this beer.
 He'll be about to take a sip of the beer,
 and then her line comes, and I'm like,
 just drink the beer, Kevin.
 Drink the beer, Kevin!
 So I wonder if there's a, I have to eat it otherwise,
 it'll come across really corny.
 - You're doing great.
 You're doing better than I expected you to.
 Are you doing better than, honestly.
 Are you doing better than you expected?
 - Well, I guess just based on the pure numbers,
 although Justin Timberlake did warn me
 that he did the show, and he was like,
 by the end of it, you feel drunk,
 and I'm just beginning to get a little bit of a like,
 hey, Sean, what's going on with everybody?
 - A weightlessness kind of vibe.
 - Yeah, it's like I can feel it in the back of my neck.
 - It's nice.
 - And so far, it's really pleasant,
 and I'm just gonna enjoy that,
 because I think it's gonna get unpleasant really soon.
 - Well, we're not gonna blow the high just yet.
 Not gonna blow the high just yet.
 I think we'll just enhance a little bit.
 And what a sauce, by the way, to enhance on
 with this one right here, Dreams of Calypso.
 That's only gonna take us higher.
 - If you say so, you son of a bitch.
 (laughing)
 Okay, okay.
 (sighing)
 I really don't like that they taste good at first.
 It's almost like manipulative.
 - Yeah, right.
 They put a little pineapple in there, a little mango,
 so it's like a little bit of sweetness.
 - But it's really, really, really nice.
 And then I can feel that it's about to start hurting me.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - I'm a bad person.
 This mermaid is a bad mermaid.
 - So I've heard you declare your love of films
 from the '30s and '40s, which is a time period
 that even the most devoted Criterion Collection fan
 may not know a lot about.
 - Ah, uh-huh.
 - Off the top of your head,
 and without thinking about it too much,
 can you recommend a film or two as an on-ramp
 to that era of Hollywood filmmaking?
 - Sure.
 Well, The Women is my favorite film of all time.
 It's from 1939.
 I love Arsenic and Old Lace.
 Like, there's something.
 There's something so charming and endearing
 about Cary Grant discovering that his two spinster aunts
 are murdering tenants.
 But it's like a slapstick comedy,
 but then it gets really dark.
 Like, Peter Lorre shows up and it gets really fucked up.
 And then at one point he's like tied up,
 and you're just like, "Oh, he's so cute."
 You know, like sweet little Cary Grant just being...
 Oh, okay.
 Anna.
 I was racing through that.
 - Yeah, I saw that.
 - And then it just came to a screeching halt.
 And that's okay.
 I'm not sure if it was Peter Lorre.
 Please cut that if it's not Peter Lorre in the film.
 Okay.
 - What are the perfect atmospheric conditions
 for a Lord of the Rings watch party?
 - The Lord of the Rings.
 I do feel kind of stoned.
 - Yeah, that's what happens.
 That's what happens.
 That's what I'm chasing.
 - Okay.
 (laughing)
 I can feel it.
 - I do feel kind of stoned.
 - Okay.
 This is really interesting.
 Okay, because...
 You can tell that I'm feeling stoned
 because I'm talking like in my headphones.
 (laughing)
 Because I feel like I...
 I took a break from smoking weed for a good couple years
 'cause it was starting to just make me paranoid.
 And now that it's legal and regulated,
 I've been dipping my toe back in,
 but there's still that kind of paranoia
 that it's gonna tip the other direction.
 But obviously I did not know that this was available to me.
 I don't care for the pain, but this is fun.
 - The physiological effects that result.
 - Yeah, this feels similar to getting high with my roommate
 when I was like 20 and like walking to Ralph's
 and having like stoner obstacles.
 - Yeah, like an innocent giggly high.
 - Uh-huh.
 This is great.
 (laughing)
 Okay.
 - To bomb beyond insanity.
 - Okay.
 - Did I get any on me?
 - No, you look great.
 You're good.
 And this is like where we might kind of blow the high.
 - Well, then it's pretty rude that it's not the end.
 (laughing)
 Okay, I'm gonna be really careful about touching my face.
 Oh, I don't care for this.
 - No, not at all.
 - Yep.
 - Yeah.
 - Woo!
 - We got it.
 Happy place.
 - Wait, why the ears?
 Why the ears, Sean?
 - The ears I don't know about.
 Like are they like poppin' like an airplane kind of?
 - Yep.
 Why?
 - That I don't, that's new.
 - That's new?
 - That's new.
 Well, no, no, no, no.
 We have a long, long history of people
 having their ears popped.
 - Don't bullshit a bullshitter, Sean.
 You're a bad actor. - Everybody comes back.
 Everybody comes back.
 - Uh-huh.
 - Everybody comes back down to earth.
 - Okay.
 - We make it.
 We make it.
 How about now?
 - This feels like that scene in Aladdin
 when he's like, get on the magic carpet.
 He's like, do you trust me?
 And I'm like, no, Sean.
 I don't fucking trust you anymore.
 - Right, no, I get that.
 I get that, I get that.
 - Okay.
 Okay.
 - All right.
 - This is so much fun.
 - Yeah, you're having a good time?
 - I'm having so much fun.
 Yeah, you remember that bad attitude I was talking about?
 - Uh-oh, it's coming.
 I'm ready for it and I deserve it.
 I deserve it.
 But you're doing so good.
 - What's wrong with you?
 - You're doing, I don't know.
 I don't know.
 - Do people do this without getting upset at you?
 - You know, it's a range.
 It's always kind of like an emotional roller coaster.
 You know, like sometimes you get like,
 there's like a little bit of like trauma bonding
 that happens.
 Sometimes it goes the opposite direction.
 Sometimes I make lifelong friends doing this show.
 You know what I mean?
 Like it really is a range of emotions.
 - Okay.
 - But I understand totally what you're going through.
 - I'm literally trying to think of an experience
 in my life to compare this to.
 And one is not coming to mind.
 - The kidney stones?
 - I guess the kidney stones,
 where it feels like things are kind of coming in
 and out of the room.
 - Yeah.
 - Like things are disappearing and it's just you and me.
 - Yeah.
 - And so far you haven't left yet.
 - Right, I'm still here.
 - But ho.
 - Still connected, but nobody else is in the room.
 - Nobody else.
 It's just you and me and like a black abyss of pain.
 - It's like the end of the woods set.
 You know, it's like the Truman Show.
 - Where?
 - Who knows where it ends and does it go forever?
 - I just wanna find the end.
 - Right, right.
 - Okay.
 - In a 2015 interview with Stylist UK,
 you talked about how eating macaroni and cheese
 is kind of a post-award show ritual for you.
 - Yeah.
 - All in, what would you say is the most extravagant
 or expensive ensemble that you've ever worn
 while just like housing Easy Mac?
 - Oh, I mean, I think probably the Met Gala.
 You feel like maybe I'm actually really fancy.
 You know, I was in a museum all night.
 And then you go home and you're just eating mac and cheese.
 And yeah, to have that in the experience
 of the peak of masquerading as a kind of glossy facade
 of what you thought the pinnacle of Hollywood was,
 it's really beautiful and it's really eye-opening,
 but not eye-opening the way that this is.
 This makes me wanna die.
 Sometimes when I'm shooting, I am so cold.
 And it's not cold like discomfort,
 it's cold like I'm suffering.
 - Yeah.
 - And then they call action and I have to just be fine.
 Right?
 Okay.
 So give me a little countdown and call action.
 Okay?
 But I'm really gonna try to take it seriously.
 - All right.
 - Okay.
 - Quiet on set.
 Quiet on set.
 Quiet on set.
 - I hate all of you.
 - And action.
 - Okay.
 (upbeat music)
 - Incredible.
 - It's pretty good.
 - Incredible.
 What role did the store Yellow Rat Bastard play
 in shaping your personal style as a young actor?
 - Oh Jesus.
 It was a product of its time.
 And, oh for fuck's sake.
 Okay.
 It was a product of its time.
 And so, you know, style changes, taste changes.
 And, you know, so you can't just know like,
 oh, how would I feel about that as an adult?
 But I can say that, you know,
 when I was like 12 in the late nineties,
 I just thought it was the coolest fucking store in history.
 But I remember like wearing them
 as a freshman in high school and just thinking,
 thinking I was so cool, such a bad-ass,
 but I had like a t-shirt that said orgy on it or something.
 I don't know.
 - The Baywatch tee.
 - The Baywatch tee.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 And the fact that like, it would be like,
 wow, I got it in New York.
 You know, I really felt some type of way about that.
 - All right, Anna Kendrick.
 - What's happening?
 What's happening?
 Sean.
 - You don't have to.
 - Yes I do.
 - Oh, okay.
 Then I won't stop you.
 - Oh, okay.
 Does that look like a--
 - That looks great.
 Textbook.
 - Okay.
 - All right.
 Cheers Anna Kendrick.
 - I'll see you in hell.
 - Cheers.
 Oh God.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Oh God.
 I bit it too fast and I think some of it went in my face.
 Oh God.
 We'll find out in a second.
 - But you know, the good news is,
 Anna Kendrick, we have slayed the hot sauce dragon,
 as Viola Davis would say.
 And just one more hoot before we get you out of here.
 Don't worry, not gonna bust out the cups
 or play the Annie Up instrumental.
 But what I wanna do is take you back through this journey.
 You know, your love of cinema starts with this passion
 for movies from the 30s and 40s,
 nominated for a Tony Award when you're 12 years old,
 and then becoming one of the most prolific actors
 over the last two decades.
 But to close it out, my question is,
 how has working in the business of Hollywood for so long,
 how has it enhanced or detracted from the enjoyment
 that you get out of movies?
 - Oh God.
 I feel like, first of all,
 I don't know how you talk coherently during this,
 so my hat's off.
 - Thank you.
 - But I think, wait, one more lady like.
 - Yep.
 - Okay.
 Okay, I think that when you start making movies,
 there's a period where they're kind of ruined for you,
 'cause you're just thinking about like all the,
 behind the scenes and how the sausage gets made of it all.
 And now I feel like it's just sort of second nature,
 that's like a running script in the back of my head.
 And so when a movie is really bad, it's so much worse,
 because it's like, I can see like, why that choice?
 And it would have been so easy to just do this or whatever.
 And when it's good, the running script is not just like,
 I'm immersed in the movie and it's great.
 There's a thing in the background of like, oh my God,
 like every department just nailed it.
 And I kind of get this like bonus appreciation
 for all these people that came together and made this thing.
 And I'm gonna pretend
 that I'm just really emotional about it.
 And that's why I'm breathing really heavy
 and I'm sweating and maybe gonna pass out.
 I just love movies so much.
 - It's all a character choice.
 And look at you, Anna Kendrick,
 taking on the wings of death, living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do,
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 (sighs)
 - I don't know.
 I'm falling apart.
 I'm finding myself.
 I'm becoming a new woman.
 You know, God's working on all of us.
 Every day is a new journey.
 It's one step at a time.
 Have a movie out, but whatever, man.
 See it, don't see it.
 Do what makes you happy.
 Don't do this.
 If you do this on the regular, I don't know.
 My hat's off.
 I love you all.
 (audience applauding)
 (screams)
 (audience applauding)
 - I don't know what's happening right now.
 (groans)
 Okay.
 Okay.
 I don't know.
 I think it might've been,
 I think it might've been around as bad
 as I thought it was gonna be.
 (groans)
 Okay, be honest.
 - Yeah.
 - Did I have, like, Blair Witch snap bubbles throughout?
 (screams)
