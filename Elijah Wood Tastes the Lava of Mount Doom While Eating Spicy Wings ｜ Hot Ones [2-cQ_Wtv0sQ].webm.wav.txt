 Now, I feel like I've drank the lava of Mount Doom.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today, we're joined by Elijah Wood.
 He's been in more than 60 films over the course
 of his more than 30-year-long acting career,
 from Academy Award-winning indies
 to one of the highest-grossing box office film
 franchises of all time.
 His latest project, though, is No Man of God,
 which is set to release in select theaters
 and on demand August 27.
 Elijah Wood, welcome to the show.
 Thank you so much for having me.
 This is a real honor.
 And you know, I've heard this story secondhand,
 but I'd like to just bring it to you directly.
 So as I understand it, you're doing an interview or a podcast
 on this floor in this building, see the Hot One sauces
 on display, and you're like, out of curiosity,
 I'd like to try those out.
 Is that more or less how the adventure starts,
 and then where does it go from there?
 More or less.
 Yes, I didn't realize that Hot Ones was filmed
 in this particular location.
 So when I got here, I was like, oh, shit,
 I've always wanted to be on the show.
 Man, that would be amazing.
 And they were like, well, if you want
 to try some of the hot sauces just
 as a separate little internet bit, we can do that.
 I was like, sure, let's do that.
 And so we tried a couple of sauces,
 including this one here, the bomb.
 I'm very familiar with this.
 The friend and colleague who I was with,
 Tim League, who created the Alamo Drafthouse Theater, which
 you may know, he then has a very severe reaction to this sauce,
 to which the ambulance was called.
 Outside, my friend's doing better,
 having a conversation with some of the people that work on the floor,
 and I start to get this warm sensation in my stomach that
 just continues to grow and grow and grow.
 And I thought, oh, shit, this is it.
 And I ended up also on my knees in a severe amount of pain.
 Well, respect for coming back to try it again, Elijah.
 Thank you.
 Are you ready to get started?
 Yes.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Oh, it's fantastic.
 Heat with heart, it says.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 That's great.
 I mean, that's warm.
 It's nice.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 So your new film, No Man of God, chronicles the interviews
 between serial killer Ted Bundy and FBI agent Bill Hagmeyer,
 who's credited with coaxing the criminal confession out
 of the campus killer.
 Thinking back on the real-life consultations
 that you actually had with the real Bill Hagmeyer,
 what interested you most about the chemistry
 or the psychological interplay between FBI agent and serial killer?
 Oh, man, I think the ability to be in a room with someone like that
 and find their humanity to a degree--
 so it's one thing to go into that room looking for information
 from a psychological standpoint, which is what Bill was doing.
 But it's another thing entirely to also see that person
 as another human, which he also had to do in order
 to have those interactions for Ted to feel safe,
 to be able to express and sort of reveal the things
 that he needed him to reveal.
 We know a lot about Ted.
 That was a thing I didn't know.
 I didn't realize that there was this agent that
 had spent this kind of time with him
 over the course of the four years prior to his death.
 Yeah, like calling him his best friend and stuff like that.
 Ted literally said that he was his best friend.
 And I think for Ted, the reason why
 he considered Bill his best friend
 is that, unlike other FBI agents and law enforcement
 whom he didn't trust, it's because those guys had an agenda.
 More often than not, he assumed that they would go off
 and write a book about their conversations.
 Bill never did.
 And I think that's why he trusted him
 and why he considered him a friend at the end,
 because he didn't come in with an agenda he really
 wanted to understand.
 Oh, that's nice.
 Artisanal chili sauce.
 So beyond the frozen pizza aisle,
 I know that you're somewhat of a gourmand.
 And you're oftentimes taking pictures of ramen
 and then researching the restaurant scene fanatically
 wherever you go.
 Yes.
 Without a food obsessive visiting you in Austin,
 what would be the most mouthwatering itinerary
 you could put together?
 Like the best breakfast, lunch, and dinner move
 you could make in that city?
 Breakfast tacos at El Primo, which
 is a taco truck on South First Street near Mary.
 Pizza Via 313 for lunch.
 It's probably my favorite pizza in the world.
 It's a Detroit-style pizza.
 It is exceptional.
 And then dinner, ramen tazza is incredible.
 That would be a great one.
 Shoyu ramen is amazing.
 The tonkatsu is incredible.
 And they have a slider that is a pork katsu slider that
 is the stuff of dreams.
 Honestly, if I could eat one every day, I would.
 It's a pork katsu, very small.
 It's on a little slider bun with a kind of coleslaw.
 And it's just phenomenal.
 Do you have an all-time favorite Elijah Wood movie
 scene involving food?
 The hot sauce and lime scene in "The Trust"
 is special for me personally.
 That's a very good one.
 That's a very good one.
 Involving food.
 I mean, you've sort of stolen it.
 That's a great one.
 That's a great one for a couple of reasons.
 One, it's opposite Nicolas Cage, which was, for me,
 the first time as an actor, genuinely,
 that I had an out-of-body experience working
 with another actor.
 And I remember being in scenes, conversing with him,
 and he would say something to me.
 And I would think in my brain as I'm acting opposite him,
 oh my god, that's Nicolas Cage.
 The way he said that was so like Nicolas Cage.
 Oh my god.
 So one of my favorite experiences as an actor
 was working opposite him.
 He was a delight.
 And to get to see his creative process was a joy.
 And that scene is hilarious.
 So yeah, I'm sorry.
 I don't have a better answer.
 You really kind of made the answer perfect.
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
 Oh, intensely spicy just one drop hot sauce.
 Fuck, that's good.
 Mm-hmm.
 Way more than one drop.
 These are also very good wings.
 Shout out, shorties.
 Hey, shorties.
 It's your birthday.
 So at this point, I know that you've
 done more than your fair share of necropsies
 surrounding Lord of the Rings.
 But on this wing, what we want to do
 is fact check some of the fables that have made their way
 onto internet message boards and into the headlines
 and just fact check them with somebody
 who has boots on the ground.
 Great.
 Is it true that after winning 11 Oscars at the Academy
 Awards in 2002, you, director Peter Jackson, and the crew
 ditched the traditional post-show celebrations
 to instead go to a Lord of the Rings fan party that was put on
 by the One Ring website?
 Correct.
 Yeah, we went around to a couple of parties
 and then we ended up there and spent the majority
 of our evening at the onering.net party.
 It was truly the end of the journey for us.
 Being able to then go back and celebrate with the fans
 was the only thing to do.
 And nothing against the Vanity Fair party
 and those sort of events.
 They're fun, but this was like it
 didn't have any of the pressure of the fan fair.
 We could just hang out.
 And it was really nice.
 It was really nice.
 Maybe you're privy to this.
 Maybe you're not.
 Is there any truth to Peter Jackson orchestrating 20,000
 cricket fans between inning breaks to put on the sounds
 of the Yurakai army?
 Whoa.
 Is that a thing?
 I don't know if that's true.
 It would most likely be rugby, because rugby is really
 the game--
 In New Zealand.
 In New Zealand.
 I mean, they do play cricket, but I
 feel like the rugby crowd is a far more boisterous crowd
 than cricket, I would have thought.
 But I could be wrong.
 I've never been to a cricket game.
 It's a weird one, isn't it?
 It is.
 It goes on for days.
 Goes on for days.
 And sometimes it's a tie and no one wins.
 Three fucking days.
 And then finally, is it true that you let out
 the fart heard round the shire doing a hillside roll
 with your Hobbit castmates?
 First day of filming.
 Day one.
 So yeah, we're in the scene as we are rolling down the hill
 after Mary and Pippin run into us,
 running away from Farmer Maggot's field,
 having stolen a bunch of vegetables.
 They bang into us.
 We roll down the hill.
 So it's picking up that moment of falling down the hill
 and falling on top of each other in a very comedic way.
 And I think it was like take two.
 And I had a--
 what is that?
 A concussion fart.
 A fart that is brought on by pressure.
 And yeah, I literally fell.
 And everybody burst out laughing.
 It was great.
 It was very funny.
 It's a hell of a way to start filming Lord of the Rings.
 You got to announce your presence somehow.
 I have to say, all of these have been delicious.
 That one has a kind of sweetness to it
 and a little barbecue-y sort of flavor to it,
 a kind of smoky barbecue.
 That's what we're going for, kind of like a summer sauce,
 like a slow roasted meats or like grilled vegetables
 kind of hot sauce.
 That's great.
 Love that one.
 So you're the voice of Spyro the Dragon,
 likewise made an appearance in God of War.
 And then a few years ago, were hand selected by Microsoft
 to unveil the Xbox 360.
 As a video game obsessive and someone
 who I'm sure thinks about these sorts of things,
 is there a game that you think is especially ripe
 for a screenplay adaptation?
 The universe of GTA lends itself beautifully
 to a screen adaptation or a TV show.
 I mean, I think Vice City could be amazing,
 although that already is sort of inspired by Miami Vice.
 But GTA V, I mean, the kinds of characters
 that are present within the context of that game
 very much lends itself either to a film or a TV series.
 That would be amazing.
 Another thing that's happening in the world of video games
 in terms of adaptations is they're
 going back to Resident Evil.
 Yeah.
 And I'm very keen on that because the original Resident
 Evil, whether it's your thing or not,
 is very different from the game from an aesthetic standpoint.
 It was always a shame to me that they
 didn't lean on the sort of world that
 had been established in the game.
 And I think that's coming up, which I'm very excited about.
 Well, speaking of that, games like Silent Hill or Resident
 Evil, sometimes they can be a more frightening experience
 than even the most suspenseful thrillers.
 Totally.
 Psychologically, what do you think
 that they can do that maybe films aren't able to?
 Well, it's an immersive experience.
 Unlike a film which is passive, you
 are a participant in the game.
 You're playing the character.
 There are moments playing sequels of Silent Hill that
 were genuinely disturbing to play.
 You're not sitting back and watching something.
 You are making the choice to go down that hallway.
 You are making the choice to-- you know what I mean?
 And I think in that sense, there's a level of suspense
 and sort of within the context of the interactivity that
 makes it maybe more scary.
 All right, Ginger Goat, the original goat.
 Yeah.
 I feel like the habanero kicked us into gear,
 and then we've kind of been coasting a little bit.
 Yeah, the three in this season is a little jarring.
 And then it does downshift a little bit.
 It's nice, though.
 But it's about to kick back up.
 Enjoy that feeling while you can.
 Right.
 Great.
 I'm not going to-- I don't need water yet.
 I'm all right.
 All right, Elijah, we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That, Graham.
 We're doing a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll show you the pictures over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 And in preparing for this interview,
 I read a little bit about forced perspective
 and motion-controlled camera rigs.
 Can you give us one piece of cinematic wizardry
 that really blew your mind when you actually
 saw it in action on set?
 1,000%.
 So there's a scene at the back end kitchen table.
 And it was split into two pieces, where he was--
 Ian McKellen, as Gandalf, was sitting
 at one portion of the table.
 And I was sitting at another portion of the table.
 And scale-appropriate elements were at either table.
 And the table would move along with the camera
 to make sure that the angle was always appropriate to make
 him look like he was sitting in front of me
 and I was sitting opposite him.
 And I'd look at a tennis ball.
 So anytime Ian was talking to me and we're
 having the scene play out and we're talking to each other,
 I'm looking there and he is looking opposite him
 at a tennis ball.
 And in camera, it looks like we're
 sitting opposite each other and he looks giant
 and I look small.
 And that was incredible.
 And there was also the cart.
 So when I jump into the cart at the very beginning of the film,
 when Gandalf's coming into the Shire for the first time
 and you're late and a wizard's never late,
 they arrive precisely when they mean to.
 Frodo jumps into his arms and then they're sitting opposite--
 or they're sitting side by side going through having
 a conversation about Bilbo's party and so on and so forth.
 And that was a similar thing.
 I was sitting behind him and he was sitting in front of me
 and the camera was set at such an angle.
 We were going back to real basics in regards
 to the magic of cinema.
 It was awesome.
 We also had scale doubles.
 So for any wide shots, there were people that we had--
 many of them that were that size.
 So about 3 foot 8, 3 foot 6.
 That would be our doubles for anything wide.
 And they would wear masks--
 That have your face on it?
 --silicon masks with our face.
 But the masks wouldn't move.
 Excuse me.
 So that was a bit jarring because you
 would see someone walking around with your face,
 but it was inanimate.
 It was just in a fixed position.
 Made in Tucson.
 The old tux in Arizona.
 Oh, there we go.
 Yeah.
 There it is.
 A bit of a hot curry vibe.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, yeah.
 And the peppers are sitting right on top.
 Pretty hot as well.
 That's good.
 So I know that you have a deep connection to scary movies.
 It's a hobby that began when you were a child.
 And then it's grown into you co-founding Spectravision
 in 2010, a production company that focuses on horror movies.
 What can you tell people about Truth or Dare--
 A Critical Madness?
 Sir, you've done your research.
 Truth or Dare-- A Critical Madness--
 it's one of the first horror movies I remember seeing.
 The movie is about a guy who is--
 at the very beginning of the movie,
 he catches his wife sleeping with his best friend
 and colleague.
 And then he freaks out, has a pretty traumatic reaction to it,
 and leaves in a huff.
 And then he goes on this road trip and loses his mind.
 And he picks up a hitchhiker.
 And she says, would you like to play Truth or Dare?
 And he's like, yeah, OK.
 Truth or Dare?
 All right.
 Play Truth or Dare.
 And it goes from throw your wallet in the fire,
 you know, pretty intense thing.
 But all right.
 He's on this journey to cut your tongue out.
 It's sublime.
 It's so great.
 The performances are not good.
 It's just-- I got a warm hug all over right now.
 It's great.
 So this is really fun.
 You're having a good time.
 I'm loving this.
 All right, number seven.
 I'm waiting for you, man.
 All right.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I mean, yeah, of course.
 Oh, sure.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, man, when you get to that level, that kind of like,
 I know that flavor.
 I know what's up.
 I know what's about to happen.
 Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying by that.
 I'll know when something's a super hot--
 1,000%.
 --from the second I smell it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, the scent and that first--
 yeah, that first taste on your taste buds.
 Wow, that's good, man.
 That's good.
 Now we're cooking with gas.
 Yeah.
 That'll go.
 I'm always curious with an actor who's as prolific as you are,
 is there an under-the-radar project
 that when a fan brings it up to you on the street,
 it maybe hits you emotionally a little bit differently?
 Yes, that is such a great question, by the way.
 That is not something that I hear often.
 But it is in relation to a reaction
 that I often have, which is when someone brings something up
 that isn't as common as, say, "Lord of the Rings," which
 is obviously the most common thing.
 There's a couple.
 "Over the Garden Wall" is a big one.
 It's an animated miniseries on Cartoon Network,
 this sort of beautiful 2D animation style
 that feels very much like it evokes something from the past.
 It's really stunning.
 "Grand Piano," that still remains
 one of my favorite experiences working on a film.
 And on the production side of things,
 I get really excited when people reference "The Greasy
 Strangler," because that is not something that many people have
 seen.
 And it's a polarizing movie.
 It's a movie not for everyone.
 And so when people are enthusiastic
 and have seen the movie, I get very excited,
 because I think it's incredible.
 You recognize that wavelength.
 It's a specific wavelength.
 And I am very much on that wavelength, yeah.
 All right.
 It is that time.
 Oh, fuck.
 All right, here we go.
 Back.
 All right, Tim League, this one's for you.
 Avenging.
 Yep.
 OK.
 There's a sort of dryness to it.
 It sort of feels like someone's dusted it with hot peppers.
 That's a good way to put it, because that's how I feel.
 Right now, I think I inhaled just the right way.
 Oh.
 And just, yeah, caught like a pepper buck shot right
 in the esophagus.
 And I definitely had-- yeah, right in the back.
 This is going to suck later.
 It really is.
 So I know that you have a passion for music,
 DJing for more than 10 years.
 And over that time, built up a massive vinyl collection.
 What's the last Retro 45 that you bought off eBay?
 I'll tell you what.
 The hot sauce really fucks with your brain.
 It does.
 And its capability of being able to answer,
 which is really a clever aspect of the show.
 See what you've done here.
 Yeah, you've really kept the interview on its toes.
 From-- the last 45 that I bought was actually a Kanye West 45.
 Wash This In The Blood, that's the name of the song.
 Wow, that is really fucking hot.
 It's weird because I've had that before, but maybe not so much.
 I think I only had like a little dab last time.
 This is a whole wing.
 It's like-- what's fascinating what's happening right now
 is that it actually--
 I feel like the capillaries in my face are on fire.
 And maybe that's also because I touched my face with that.
 Yeah, I think I did too around my nose.
 We're suffering together in this.
 How about--
 Oh, yeah.
 Of all the original pressings that you own,
 which one required the most time and effort to track down?
 There's a 45 from a Welsh band called Bran.
 It's like a psychedelic Welsh band that I've
 had a difficulty tracking down.
 And that's very good.
 And I have that now.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 And that's not even the end.
 That's great.
 That's great.
 But this is why we do this, you know?
 This is why we go through it.
 Yeah.
 The experience.
 Well, I may have--
 I may not have actually physically thrown
 a ring into Mount Doom.
 But now I feel like I've drank the lava of Mount Doom.
 Yeah.
 Apologize.
 There's so many burps.
 Yeah, I mean, once you've destroyed your mouth--
 Everything else.
 --everything's just like, whatever.
 More of the same.
 You know?
 You've lit the fire.
 The fire's going.
 Can't get hotter.
 No, it's an inferno.
 So in 2006, you were ranked number seven--
 This is my favorite part of the show.
 --an autographed collector magazines--
 Ed, we're back to the interview.
 Let's try him.
 Let's try him.
 Synapses fire and communicate with your mouth.
 An autographed collector magazines list--
 Yeah.
 --of the 10 best Hollywood autograph signers.
 What's your guiding philosophy when
 it comes to dealing with the autographed hounds
 of Hollywood?
 This is so flattering.
 With autographed hounds, specifically?
 Yeah.
 Oh, bud.
 That's a tough one.
 Because there's a separation between fans who genuinely
 want to meet you and have an autograph,
 and then the people who collect it and sell the photos.
 I know what's going on, but I can't bring myself to say no,
 because I don't want to be a dick.
 Sometimes they can make it a-- excuse me-- a bummer for fans.
 Because they'll crowd a space, and if there's an event
 that people know that they're going to be there,
 there's loads of fans, but then there's
 also tons of autographed hounds that will have multiples.
 And that can ruin it for people who care.
 So that's kind of a bummer.
 But I'll always sign, because I just--
 you know, I like to be nice.
 It's hard for me to be a dick.
 I don't want to be a dick.
 All right, Elijah Wood.
 Oh, is this the last dab?
 [LAUGHS]
 Hey, it's the last dab.
 This is a hot session, I feel like.
 I'm noticing.
 I'm seeing you react more than I feel
 like I've ever seen you react, which I'm honored.
 Just for you, Elijah.
 I'm honored.
 Just for you.
 Oh, was that too much?
 Someone just said, oh, god.
 What did I do?
 What did I do?
 Yeah, yeah.
 We've seen it all before.
 OK.
 Ready?
 Cheers.
 Cheers, my friend.
 Nastrovia.
 Skull!
 What's the story with the last dab?
 So, Smoke and Ed--
 Oh, is this a creation of his?
 Yeah, so this is made with Pepper X, which
 is his next generation Reaper.
 But it's just Ed growing it on just this farm.
 He's a fucking madman.
 So we got in with Ed to get the Pepper X
 and just make this sauce with it.
 That's rad.
 So that's the last dab, yeah.
 That's rad.
 That's-- yeah, man.
 But again, I think once you're primed--
 I mean, this is beautifully curated.
 I must say, it's like a symphony,
 starting off really slow.
 I mean, maybe it's like a little single cello here.
 And then you just keep adding elements and elements.
 And this kind of--
 there's a ramp up.
 I mean, it's beautiful.
 It's like a conductor.
 And this guy--
 I mean, this is like Stravinsky comes in with the fucking--
 you know what I mean?
 It's intense.
 But once that starts, I just don't
 feel like this was the absolute destroyer.
 Yeah.
 This is when things were brought to a new level.
 But I'm there now.
 So I'm like, well, fucking whatever.
 Last dab?
 Well, you know what I mean?
 You're primed.
 You're sort of--
 I feel numb.
 Elijah.
 It's because maybe it's because you see through this whole
 thing.
 But that really connected with me, really spoke to me,
 because that's what we try to do.
 We actually call it a spice symphony.
 You do?
 Yes.
 Hey!
 Internally, behind the scenes.
 And then the other thing about it is we
 do think of it like a story arc.
 Once we hit this, we do want to kind of land it a little bit.
 I don't even know if you can.
 You can't be on an ascent the whole time.
 And then just crank, crank, crank, crank, crank, crank,
 roll credits.
 No, you can't do that.
 Like, you don't want to do that.
 No.
 You've got to land the plane.
 You've got to land the plane.
 Yeah.
 Oh, man.
 And this is a beautiful way to--
 boom.
 [LAUGHTER]
 This is a beautiful way to do that.
 This has been awesome.
 And we're not done yet.
 Well, you know what?
 I had a question.
 But I don't even know if it's--
 because this was such a beautiful conversation
 to encapsulate the experience that I almost want to just--
 Call it.
 --snap it off right there for Elijah Wood, who's
 somebody who's seen the show, watched the show,
 experienced a practice run of the show,
 and now sitting down for the real thing.
 Yeah.
 This has been really fun.
 And I am honored.
 And I have been a longtime watcher.
 And this is very cool for me.
 This guy.
 Old trusty, forever the benchmark,
 in the show for years, and it had to stay here,
 because it had to be here for you, Elijah Wood.
 Thank you.
 And look at you, taking on the Hot Ones gauntlet,
 conquering it the second time around,
 this time with some stakes and a few million witnesses.
 And now, Elijah Wood, there's nothing left to do but roll out
 the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 Well, you can-- yeah, you can go see,
 either in theaters or on demand,
 a movie called No Man of God about Ted Bundy
 and his relationship to Bill Hagmeyer, the FBI agent.
 And I'm about to make a film with a certain Macon Blair
 called The Toxic Avenger, which will be super fun.
 We worked together on a movie called I Don't Feel at Home
 in This World Anymore, which I adore.
 And he is remaking Toxic Avenger.
 So I'm about to go shoot that.
 Camera guy Bill, I can't tell you how hyped he is.
 Namaste.
 He was talking about that.
 Namaste.
 This is awesome.
 Thank you so much.
 This was really fun.
 Good job, Alessio.
 Thank you so much.
 Is there someone that-- has anyone vomited?
 Not like on set, but we've had some people like,
 where's the restroom, like on cut or whatever.
 Or people are like, I need to take a break in the middle
 or something like that.
 And I don't know what they do.
 Sure.
 Sure, sure, sure.
 [LAUGHS]
 Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
