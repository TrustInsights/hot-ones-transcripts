 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For "First Weed Feast," I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching "Hot Ones."
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings,
 and today we're joined by Kid Cudi.
 He's a Grammy Award-winning artist, multi-hyphenate entertainer,
 and true to form, he just dropped a brand-new album
 accompanied by an animated TV special of the same name.
 It's called "Entergalactic."
 Check out the album wherever you get your music
 and watch the special, which is now currently streaming on Netflix.
 Kid Cudi, welcome to the show.
 - Thanks for having me, man.
 - I feel like this is one of those shoots
 that's been literally years in the making.
 - Yeah. - What's going through your head
 as you finally prepare to take on the hot ones going with?
 - I'm confident that I'm gonna make it to the end, you know?
 But I have no idea what I'm gonna experience on this journey.
 I'm really, uh, really kind of nervous.
 - I'm not gonna lie.
 - Yeah, let's do it.
 - No.
 No.
 I can eat more if I want, right?
 - Go ahead, and I'll follow you right along with.
 - That was good.
 That was good.
 Nice.
 - So dating back to the original "Man on the Moon,"
 your albums have always had a cinematic, sonic quality to them,
 so I can only imagine how cathartic it must have been for you
 to take "Entergalactic" and then actually storyboard it out
 for an animated adaptation.
 And then costume design, it's not a discipline
 that you'd often associate with animation,
 but it really is at the heart of "Entergalactic's" aesthetic.
 What role did Virgil Abloh play
 in shaping the fashion of this world?
 - Well, um, it was really like I put it all on him, you know?
 I really went into this knowing that, like,
 I wanted the characters to be fresh.
 I didn't want it to be like, you know,
 a typical animated show where you see one character
 wearing the same thing every episode, you know?
 Virgil came through and just put his magic sauce on it
 and just made, you know, a wardrobe for each character
 that matched their personality.
 I was so, like, happy 'cause I was like, "Oh, my God."
 Like, this was the best idea I could have ever came up with.
 You know, we could have been in this
 and making some really shitty clothing, you know?
 But I have, like, the illest, freshest motherfucker alive
 doing this shit for me, and it was just the illest, man,
 and I love him to death for that, you know?
 ♪♪
 Man, these first two, I need them to go.
 Mm-hmm.
 - So in the "A Man Named Scott" documentary,
 playing Pat says of first working with you,
 "It was so different and weird
 that I'd feel uncomfortable, but I love it."
 Was there a watershed moment?
 Maybe it was a song. Maybe it was a show
 where it went from this sort of experimental,
 bohemian exercise to all of a sudden record labels
 and a bidding war for you?
 - I think it was the mixtape
 'cause the mixtape was playful and fun.
 It was just all about, like, showing people I could rap.
 You know, the album was like,
 "No, this is, like,
 the Oscar-nominated version of an album," you know?
 I lived with Dot for almost three years,
 and during this time, we were making music,
 and we made "Day and Night" and a number of other records,
 and from there, we added Emile,
 and then it was just like, when I had those three guys,
 I was golden.
 - And I liked even hearing from Emile when he was talking about
 how he'd play you beats that he prepared,
 but you wouldn't really react to those things.
 It wasn't until he would just be, like, playing a synth
 or, like, pulling out old records.
 - Yeah, I mean, that's-- 'cause, you know,
 that's the shit that was, like--
 the type of records he would play, you know,
 were always, like, interesting and, like, weird, you know?
 And that was, you know, my shit.
 Like, I just wanted something that didn't sound
 like the typical shit that you would hear in hip-hop,
 you know, like, with Ghost.
 Like, you hear Ghost, you hear that sample.
 I was like, "What the fuck?" You know?
 Like, and Ghost is still, to this day,
 like, one of my top three favorite songs.
 - You're crushing it. Are you ready to move on
 to wing number three? This is Pico Rico here.
 And you're doing great. - Oh, man.
 Pico Rico, let's go, coño!
 - Ha ha ha!
 - Mmm.
 These first three, I'm good.
 But I see, when I get down to here,
 it's probably gonna get real.
 - [laughs]
 So even as your music career exploded,
 you've still remained a prolific actor,
 and earlier this year, it was announced
 that you'd be making your directorial debut
 on an upcoming Netflix project called "Teddy."
 What's the best audition tip or note
 that you've ever gotten from Timothée Chalamet?
 - I think I asked him about crying on camera once.
 - Mmm. - [laughs]
 You know, I've given him, like, audition tapes
 that I've done before, and I'm just like,
 "Hail, man, that should be straight."
 You know? He's always like, "Oh, it's good, it's good."
 He's like--I don't know, he could be lying to me.
 [laughs]
 But he's always very supportive,
 and I know Timmy is a fan of me
 for music, but, you know, I think he's a fan of me
 as an actor as well.
 My lips are tingling.
 - Well, a whole lot more is about to happen
 as we work our way down, but...
 - Gibs is gonna fall. - First things first.
 The Hot Ones, barbacoa, I guess.

 Maybe you'll be the only one standing by the end of this.

 But you do this. You do this all the time.
 You do this on the rig.

 [laughter]
 And you're just gonna say--
 like, that's what I'm gonna ask you after this, man.
 - Sure, you can ask me during whatever, you know?
 This can go both ways over here.
 - Your bowels are probably like, "What the fuck?"
 - You know what's fascinating?
 Is your body adjusts.
 You know, you do a show like "Hot Ones" this long.
 I'll go to Equinox after this.
 You know what I mean? - Oh, no way.
 - I'm unstoppable. I'm unstoppable.
 I mean, who knows?
 Like, I don't want to get overconfident.
 It's like an athlete, you know?
 Like, I think you probably have a physical prime,
 and then, you know,
 maybe the wings will start to slow me down.
 But right now, I'm good.
 Right now, I'm good. - Oh, my God.

 All right, Kid Cudi, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called "Explain That Gram,"
 where we do a deep dive on our guests on screen
 and pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 And for you, we have a theme.
 It's a Kid Cudi-style retrospective.
 So what we've done is we've pulled
 some of our favorite Kid Cudi fit pics,
 and we're just curious how you react,
 how you reflect looking back on those things now.
 - Oh, my God. - All right.
 Laptop, please, Bill. There we go.
 Bring it back with the laptop. - All right.
 - Very rare. Thank you very much.
 Do you have a favorite memory
 from walking at the Palais Royal Gardens
 for Virgil Abloh's first Louis Vuitton collection?
 - Yes, I do.
 It just didn't feel real, you know?
 The whole thing was just, like, you know,
 like a dream, you know?
 And I was soaking it up so much that, like,
 I was walking really slow on the runway.
 So, like, you can't see in this picture, like,
 there's, like, all those people stacked up behind me.
 - That's a traffic jam behind you?
 [laughter]
 - And that's why this person got this good-ass photo,
 'cause it was, like, 20 feet between me
 and the other dude in front of me.
 Like, it was, like, right there.
 But I was just--I was really high,
 and I was just soaking it up, man.
 I was like, "This is a beautiful moment."
 So, yeah.
 - What's the biggest difference
 between working at a Bape store
 and working at Abercrombie & Fitch?
 And then how did each shape your personal style?
 - Working at the Abercrombie & Fitch store,
 the clothes sucked,
 and it wasn't like--
 it wasn't like I was, like,
 proud to be wearing Abercrombie & Fitch.
 Like, their jeans were all right, I guess.
 Their jeans were all right, I guess.
 But when I worked at the Bape store,
 that was the first time I was like,
 "Oh, man, like, this is, like, actually some fresh shit."
 But, like, you know, I was so poor when I got that job.
 So I didn't own any Bape prior to working there.
 So I literally had the same brown,
 Baiting A, T-shirt and these jeans
 and these yellow roadsters.
 And I had that for, like, two months, that outfit.
 I used to ask my coworkers
 if I could borrow some of their clothes,
 and they would hold me down
 and let me borrow a hoodie or two.
 Working at that store was, like,
 was, like, the greatest--
 to me, at that time,
 like, it was bigger than getting a record deal, you know?
 Like, and I really wanted a record deal at that time,
 you know, but it was like,
 "Well, shit, I got the Bape store. I'm good," you know?
 Like, it just-- it was such a major thing
 because of what it meant to the culture and what it was.
 Nego came to the store with the teriyaki boys one time,
 and I met them.
 Fast forward all the years later
 when we did the Complex magazine cover.
 So it was, like, this full circle moment,
 you know, just being around the God, you know?
 It was so cool, man. So cool.
 - Bill, thank you very much. - You're welcome.
 - I got to get one of those Hot Ones T-shirts, too.
 - We got you. Put it in his to-go list.
 Put it in his to-go bag with the sauces.
 - And I want the to-go wings, too.
 - There you go. Do we have extras?
 - The first four.
 - We got to hit that rider. We got to hit that rider.
 Kid Cudi, are you ready to move on here to the back half already?
 You're doing great.
 - I'm kind of-- yeah, I'm kind of waiting for this shit
 to get real now. It's not-- it hasn't gotten real yet.
 It's kind of like, you know, a little kick,
 but it's not crazy.
 This is the C.
 - Turmeric bomb.
 See if this does it for you.
 - I mean, this shit is, like, green.
 - Fuck. This shit looks wrong.
 Oh, my God. I'm not going to take two bites.
 - Yes, it's, um-- hold on.
 I'm holding down.
 - Hip-hop icons like Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, and Snoop
 are often credited as being the first generation
 of rap superstars to really show that they can age
 along with the genre.
 I've heard you talk about how you don't want to be performing
 on stage late into your 40s, but I'm curious,
 are there people that you see as paradigms
 for what it looks like to age as an artist to you?
 - Yeah, like, um, Jay-Z for sure, you know?
 But I feel like I don't have what they have.
 [laughter]
 - Explain.
 - I just don't-- I just don't know if I want to do--
 if I want to just do music, drop albums for too much longer,
 you know?
 I'm kind of nearing the end on all things Kid Cudi, I think.
 - That sounds like kind of breaking news.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I'm really curious to see what else I can do.
 I was thinking about this, and this is, like,
 a wacky idea I had years ago.
 But, like, it would be cool to, like, one day, like,
 be a kindergarten teacher, you know?
 Just do that for, like, a couple years.
 Like, when I'm, like, 50, you know?
 Just, like, for, like, 10 years I was a kindergarten teacher,
 you know?
 And I just, like, infect the youth with that freshness.
 Like, you get them young, and then those kids will just
 sprinkle the freshness to the world,
 and I'll just be like, "Yes! Yes!"

 It just happens like this, I know.

 I'm following your lead to the strawberry shake.
 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
 [laughter]
 - Well, on the topic of cosmic disco,
 what do you mean when you describe the style of your music
 as space punk rock?
 - What was that? Repeat the question. Sweet Jesus.
 - Space punk rock.
 I've heard you describe your style of music
 as space punk rock.
 - Yeah.

 - If aliens visited Earth,
 and all you were armed with was a kid-cutty playlist

 because you find them to be so fun.
 - Exactly, and lucrative.
 - What is the sickest Bar Mitzvah that you've ever performed at?
 - Oh, my God, the very first one.
 The very first Bar Mitzvah, and they paid me 30 grand
 to do three songs.
 I come out, and I do the song, and the kids are all excited.
 I was there, and I was having a moment,
 and they were, like, taking pictures, and I was just like, "Wow."
 I feel like--it was, like, early on in my career,
 so I was just like, "Oh, my God.
 These kids make me feel more famous than I ever felt before in my life," you know?
 And then after that, I was like, "Okay, I've always wanted this Rolex,
 a presidential day-date," right?
 I totally was like, "Okay, I'm gonna take this money,
 and I'm gonna go buy this Rolex."
 So that's--and I still have that Rolex.
 I still wear it to this day, and it was a great buy.
 It was one of my most important buys,
 'cause it was, like, first off, I really, really, really, really wanted that watch,
 and I was dreaming about it before I had money,
 and then I finally got it, and I was like, "Oh, man, this is so cool," you know?
 - And you have that first bar mitzvah to thank for it.
 - Yeah. Oh, my God.
 Mmm.
