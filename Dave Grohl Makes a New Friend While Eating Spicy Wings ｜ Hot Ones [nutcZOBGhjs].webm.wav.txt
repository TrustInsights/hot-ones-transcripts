 (dramatic music)
 - Oops.
 (laughing)
 - I just had a little spit up.
 Had a little spit up.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, it's getting hot now.
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Dave Grohl.
 He's a 16 time Grammy award winning artist
 whose storied career in music has been immortalized
 in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
 on two separate occasions.
 He has a recently released New York Times
 best selling book as well, The Storyteller,
 Tales of Life and Music, and get this,
 a comedy horror movie starring the Food Fighters
 is on the way, studio 666,
 which is set to release on February 25th.
 Dave Grohl, welcome to the show.
 - Hi.
 I'm stoked, man.
 I've been waiting to do this for years.
 - You know, I would say in the years since Gordon Ramsay,
 you're probably the most requested guest
 that we've ever had on the show.
 Five years in the making.
 Finally, it's for the fans.
 Dave, are you ready to rock?
 - I am ready to rock.
 I feel like Gordon had a hard time on the show.
 - Well, the British palette.
 - Is that what it is?
 - Yeah.
 - Maybe I should have a drinking game with him sometime.
 - Oh, a drinking game you say?
 - Yeah.
 I mean, I thought, you know, to return the favor
 since you're hosting me and having me on your show
 that I would bring a couple cocktails
 and maybe every few wings we could have a little drink.
 - Let's go.
 Let's do this thing.
 - Yeah.
 (upbeat music)
 - Let's just do one little shot.
 - Let's do it.
 Let's do it.
 - Now, I don't know if you know about Pantera,
 but they're the most wicked heavy metal band of all time.
 And they would do these shots,
 they call them black tooth grins.
 And you can make it a few different ways,
 but it's basically like a little bit of crown,
 a little bit of coke.
 This is getting messy.
 And a sweet little fucking cocktail like this.
 They go back smooth.
 Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 - To Pantera.
 - To Pantera.
 - So we're gonna hit one of these real quick.
 - Hell yeah.
 - They work too.
 - There we go.
 - You gotta fucking be careful with that shit.
 (laughing)
 - I've had this sauce before.
 - No, it is good.
 No, I like it.
 That's something that I think I would have in my house.
 - Oh, well, you know what?
 That you can take along with you.
 You're not the only one. - Can I have the whole set?
 I can bring this shit home?
 - Everything.
 You're not the only one bringing gifts today, Dave.
 - It's like a consolation prize.
 - Exactly.
 - Okay.
 That's delicious.
 - So your new film, Studio 666,
 draws inspiration from the Foo Fighters 10th studio album,
 which likewise was recorded in a possibly haunted
 Encino mansion steeped in rock history.
 What were your original expectations for the project?
 I read a quote of yours recently where you enthusiastically
 and maybe even surprisingly declared, "It's a movie, movie."
 - Well, about three years ago,
 I was writing music for Medicine of Midnight.
 And when I do that, I like to demo stuff by myself
 where I'll set up a little studio, write instrumentals,
 and I'll play, you know, I'll write these things
 and send them to the guys and say,
 "Hey, what do you think?
 Does this sound like a good song?"
 But I like to do it in private.
 And so I was looking for a house where I could just like,
 shut everything off and just record.
 And then I'm in this creepy old house demoing stuff.
 I'm like, "Why don't we just make the record here,
 take a little bit of time off,
 and then make a super quick low budge slasher
 run and gun horror film?"
 And so I came up with this idea like,
 "Oh, I know, Foo Fighters is moving into a house.
 It's fucking haunted.
 I become possessed.
 I fucking kill everybody and then I go solo."
 And that was it.
 That was the pitch.
 And everyone's like, "Okay."
 And then all of a sudden there's millions of dollars
 thrown around.
 I'm like, "Wait, what?"
 It was like table reads and fucking special effects
 and shit like that.
 When we started seeing the dailies or the cuts coming back,
 we're like, "Oh my God, this is a fucking movie."
 Something we never expected we would do.
 But I feel like we're the band to do something
 that fucking stupid.
 'Cause that's all we've done for 26 years.
 You know, you watch our videos and shit.
 (gentle music)
 Caesar smoked garlic.
 I like anything smoked, I gotta be honest.
 That would go, I would hit some brisket with that.
 - You know what?
 That's such an amazing segue here to the next question
 because you're deep in abiding love of barbecue.
 You have a quote that I think would make
 any food writer jealous.
 Where you say, "You create a recipe as you would a song.
 You prepare a meal as you would a record.
 When people come back for seconds,
 well, that's your encore."
 What's the key to a good rub in your opinion?
 - Simplicity.
 So I just like a real good mixture of just salt and pepper
 'cause that'll really always bring out
 whether it's pork or beef.
 You can get fancy with sugars.
 You can get fancy with cumin and things like that.
 But I'm really simple when it comes to that stuff
 because it really comes down to the time
 and the temperature and the smoke.
 And if you let all of those things like sit and rest
 at the right place for the right amount of time,
 you want the taste of the meat,
 more so than the taste of a rub.
 That's just me.
 I mean, I love sweet barbecue too.
 But man, I love it when it's just like
 a real good piece of meat that's smoked perfectly right.
 There are the two types of barbecue chefs.
 There's like the ones that are like
 really get into the molecular breakdown
 and the fucking science of barbecue.
 And then there's the other guys that just take a pig
 and throw it on a fire and fucking wait around.
 And like, they're both amazing.
 But I love like someone like Sam Jones,
 barbecue goes back in his family
 like fucking hundred years or something like that.
 And I really respect that because then it becomes tradition.
 It's like heritage.
 - Maybe there's a connection too
 between the barbecue pit masters and the drummers.
 You know, the people who are technical
 and who are on the pace and on the timing
 and then the people who just bang the shit on.
 - Yeah.
 Well, that's every drummer's best excuse.
 Like I'm a field drummer.
 Like I don't know how to,
 and that's just because they don't fucking know
 how to do the fancy shit.
 Like that's me.
 Like, nah man, I'm like a disco drummer
 'cause I'm not fucking good enough to play Rush.
 That's basically what it is.
 - Italy vibe.
 - Oh really?
 - The Calabrian chilies, yeah.
 - Get cut subway.
 We do have one hot sauce guru in our crew,
 a dude named Sean.
 - Whoa.
 - Yeah, it's true.
 - Imagine that.
 - I told him yesterday I was coming on the show.
 He's trying to give me tips and shit.
 (laughing)
 He's like, make sure you have some milk before you go.
 It's not about the mouth,
 it's about your asshole or whatever.
 (laughing)
 - That's good advice.
 - Yeah.
 - We've had countless number of top five MC lists
 on the show and don't worry,
 I won't ask you to do one for drummers,
 but I am curious what you think people get wrong
 when they debate the greatest drummers of all time.
 - My sign of a good drummer would be
 if you hear about 15 seconds of their playing
 and you know who it is.
 No matter how technical, you just know who it is.
 - A distinct sound.
 - The feel, and feel is indefinable.
 It's like a fingerprint.
 I wrote a whole fucking essay about feel
 because some people, I think,
 believe that it can be created, but it's not.
 I mean, it's just as signature as your soul
 or your voice or your heart or whatever.
 So if you were to have a sheet of music
 and have two different drummers play
 in that same sheet of music, it would sound different
 because of their lives and their heart and soul
 and whatever, so if you hear 15 seconds of Ringo Starr,
 you fucking know it's Ringo Starr.
 If you hear 15 seconds of Jon Bonham,
 you know it's Jon Bonham.
 Are they two entirely different players?
 Absolutely.
 Is one more technical than the other?
 Absolutely.
 But does that amount to, what is that?
 Like, what does that amount to?
 You know, if your name is attached
 to a very specific thing, then you fucking got it.
 Let's do a shot!
 Let's do a shot, let's do a shot.
 I mean, that's, to me, that's the thing.
 And I think it makes sense.
 Let me see your cup.
 I'm trying to keep the ice out of it
 so you don't fucking choke on that shit.
 Here, put a little Coke in there.
 Here, consider it.
 Yeah, and I mean, you know, and drummers, dude,
 when you get fucking drummers talking about drums.
 Shit.
 You fucking get stuck.
 Cheers, motherfucker.
 Cheers, Dave.
 All right.
 That was a big ass shot.
 Woo!
 Angry Phoenix.
 Sounds like a fucking Tenacious D song.
 Oh, it's got scotch bonnets in it.
 Mm-hmm.
 You know, I spend a lot of time on YouTube.
 You do?
 'Cause I have the attention span of a gnat.
 And I do enjoy watching
 people fucking themselves up with hot sauce.
 You've seen the Hot One show before, maybe?
 Couple times.
 I mean, I can fucking rail off all of my favorite episodes.
 I got some faves, I gotta be honest.
 I love watching it.
 I thought Billie Eilish did great.
 Amazing.
 She did a good job.
 She was doing laps, running laps around the studio.
 Gordon Ramsay, just pissed the whole fucking time.
 Over 170 F-bombs, I think, in that first episode.
 That's a lot.
 The D.
 Classic.
 Classic.
 You know, actually, I'm a huge fan of Thundercat.
 I love Thundercat.
 I mean, his music's fucking--
 Amazing.
 He's a genius.
 Like, I really think he's a genius.
 And I met him for the first time
 about a month ago at a party.
 Oh, awesome.
 He was on a dance floor, just fucking dancing like this.
 And so I went up behind him
 and just started coming up around him like this.
 And his girlfriend's looking at me.
 She's laughing, but he has no idea who it is.
 And then finally, I spun him around.
 I'm right in his face.
 He's like, "Hey!"
 And I didn't say anything about his music.
 I was like, "Dude, you're the best fucking Hot Ones episode
 "I've ever seen in my life."
 Oh!
 You know what?
 Next time I see him, I can't wait
 to get that story out of him.
 He's the fucking king.
 Oh, that's awesome.
 Yeah, he's great. I love that.
 This is everything I dreamed it to be.
 You having a good time? Yeah.
 Yeah, I can taste blood.
 This is great.
 Los Calientes.
 So I'm gonna burp a lot.
 I just burp.
 Exactly. I do.
 I burp on stage too.
 And sometimes my fucking burps
 get more applause than our songs.
 FYI.
 It is a good sounding burp.
 I like this.
 Yeah. You know why I like this?
 Please tell me.
 It kinda tastes like B.O.
 (laughing)
 That's not weird.
 Is that earthy?
 Like summer day on the fucking bus.
 Yeah.
 Trying to get home, you're like.
 (whistling)
 It's good. Earthy.
 Let's say earthy. Yeah, earthy.
 Earthy. Yeah.
 It's like someone that doesn't use deodorant,
 they use fucking crystals and shit.
 Yeah, yeah. Or maybe this now.
 We'll make a spray, I think.
 (mumbling)
 (laughing)
 All right, Dave, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram.
 We're gonna do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram.
 Pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Okay.
 All right, first things first.
 In 2015, you famously finished a show in Sweden
 after falling off the stage, two songs in,
 and severely breaking your leg.
 What's the second most severe injury
 that you've ever suffered while performing?
 While performing, I remember getting hit in the face
 with a half dollar in Atlanta in like 1996.
 And I'm like, God fucking dammit.
 And went to the hospital.
 They're like, okay, we'll get with you in a couple minutes.
 I sat there for five fucking hours,
 and then they finally got to me.
 They're like, yeah, it's too late.
 Just put a band-aid on it.
 I was like, God dammit.
 Oh, I got electrocuted once on stage.
 Like for real.
 We played some fucking corporate gig
 for like Doc Martens in Las Vegas.
 And it was at like some hotel, and there was a pool.
 And the stage was right by this pool.
 And I thought it would be funny
 if I invite the whole audience into the pool with me.
 And during this like jam.
 I'm like, wee-da-loo-da-loo-da-loo.
 I'm like, come on everybody.
 And I fucking jump in the pool.
 And the whole audience follows me into the pool.
 And we're all kind of partying.
 And then I go back on stage, someone hands me the guitar,
 and I step on my distortion pedal.
 I was like, (imitates distortion)
 It was like actual electrocution.
 That sucked.
 How would you distill your connection
 to the Late Show with David Letterman
 between being his final music act
 and then paying homage to him when he gets hosted
 by Kimmel does seem like a unique bond there.
 - One of the reasons I love Letterman
 is because his show is so musical.
 He always had really cutting edge music acts on the show.
 And I mean, to be honest,
 he just seemed like a wicked smart ass.
 And those are the people I fucking hang out with.
 I want my best friend to be smarter and funnier
 and more fucking ride than anyone.
 And so I honestly felt, I spent my whole life watching him.
 So I really felt like he was my fucking friend in a way.
 He had this connection to our music.
 I guess he liked our song Everlong.
 After his heart surgery, we came back and we played a show.
 And he's a Dave, dude.
 Dave's gotta fucking stick together, you know what I mean?
 Hold on, let's do a fucking shot, Sean.
 - Let's do a fucking shot.
 - Oh, dude, we have a song called Sean.
 - You do? - We do.
 We recorded a song called Sean.
 - I didn't know that.
 - In Austin, Texas at the St. Cecilia Hotel.
 It's called Sean.
 - St. Cecilia Hotel's pretty cool.
 - It's fucking, and we recorded it in the bar
 at St. Cecilia Hotel.
 We made a whole record there.
 - What? - In the St. Cecilia Hotel.
 It's called the St. Cecilia EP.
 And we got a song called Sean.
 - Oh shit. - You know what the chorus says?
 - What? - Sean!
 (laughing)
 - Sounds like a hit.
 - To Sean. - Cheers, Dave.
 - It was not a hit, by the way.
 - Woo!
 (soft music)
 - So, it's interesting. - Want a shot?
 - Sure.
 - Let's go ahead, line it up.
 - Let's fucking double up.
 What were you talking about?
 (laughing)
 - Cheers, Dave.
 - Sean!
 I'm gonna send you that fucking song.
 - I can't wait.
 - Woo, buyakasha.
 - Buyakasha.
 - All right.
 - So it's interesting to me that when you began your career,
 stardom meant teenagers putting your poster on the wall
 and being the definition of untouchable.
 But now we live in an era of such widespread accessibility
 and so many different ways to reach an audience.
 What excites you most when you see young artists
 building a wave in the internet age?
 And then what, if anything, worries you
 about the new ways that music is discovered and consumed?
 - I still believe that the most important way
 to promote yourself as an artist
 is to fucking play live.
 That's it.
 Because when someone sees, when a human being
 sees another human being on stage ripping,
 there is this sort of connection.
 And it's inspiring because you're like,
 "Oh my God, human beings can do that."
 You know, I think we've been so conditioned
 to everything becoming kind of mechanical in a way
 that you see it and you're like,
 "Oh yeah, that's cool.
 Like, yeah, look at the lights
 and look at all the fucking shit."
 But if you see someone sitting in front of you,
 with just wooden wires shredding a guitar,
 or someone with an amazing voice and no microphone,
 or like the Preservation Hall Jazz Band in New Orleans,
 you go sit in that tiny room and there's no microphones,
 there's no nothing, it's just church pews and a jazz band,
 and it moves your heart, that's the way to do it.
 I'm convinced.
 So I remember years ago looking at like a festival schedule
 and seeing this band, Alabama Shakes,
 and they're like halfway up the bill on the side stage.
 Coming back to the festival like a year or two later
 and seeing Alabama Shakes headlining the side stage,
 I'm like, "Oh damn."
 And then a couple years later coming back
 and they're fucking halfway up the main stage.
 And I'm like, "Oh shit."
 Coming back a couple years later
 and now they're headlining the main stage.
 Then going to the fucking Grammys
 and we're in the same category as them
 and they fucking take the Grammy.
 That's how you're supposed to do it.
 That's what I think.
 Gotta get out there, beat the fucking street,
 and play live and be a badass.
 If you're a fucking badass, that shit will happen.
 But you gotta work it.
 I'm gonna fucking throw up, how about that?
 It's a little sweet and sticky.
 - And then that profound pepper hits,
 but look at you, Dave Grohl.
 - I mean, it's hot.
 It's good, no, that's a good hot sauce.
 And you're right, that is a good barbecue sauce.
 It's got a little sweet in it.
 - Yep.
 - It's got a little sticky on it.
 You could put it on some shit.
 - So I read that Foo Fighters recorded an album, two tapes,
 so that nobody can mess with it afterwards.
 In your opinion, does overproducing
 or over-manipulating a song undermine
 what it means to make music in any way?
 - For the Foo Fighters?
 - Yes.
 - For other people?
 I don't know.
 I like imperfection.
 I like to hear albums where you can hear a hand
 going up and down the strings
 and there's like finger slidings
 and then like the tempo goes like this.
 And that's the human element of music.
 I dig that.
 - I don't have hair, but I felt like I got like,
 it was like that Maxwell tapes commercial
 from back in the day.
 - What was I saying?
 - Pardon me while I pontificate
 about the human element of music.
 No, I mean, you know what?
 There are some things about music,
 like really rigid mechanical music that I fucking love.
 I really do.
 I think we're kind of best when it sounds like us
 and it's raw.
 I've heard about Da Bomb.
 - Cups are empty.
 - Get some motherfucker.
 Come on, Sean.
 Let's go, baby.
 Let's go.
 - Do this.
 - All right, Dave.
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 To Da Bomb.
 - I have a question.
 What's the most painful thing that's ever happened to you?
 - Oh.
 - Other than being dumped at the prom.
 What's the most painful?
 - Well, that was you.
 - Shit.
 - At homecoming on the...
 - Oh, you motherfucker.
 (laughing)
 - I read the book, Dave.
 I read the fucking book.
 I read the book.
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 - Here's to heartbreak.
 - Whew.
 - Ugh.
 Da Bomb.
 - Sit it.
 Dude, it's crazy that this is your fucking job.
 - Well, your job's fucking crazy too.
 - Yeah, I guess so.
 (laughing)
 I'm just trying to be as badass as Lord
 and fucking Thunderfans.
 - Well, you're Lord-esque right now.
 - If you could do...
 Yeah, but she had all these culinary notes.
 Like, "Ew, I like the smoky taste of the fucking man there."
 - I'm hiccuping over here.
 - That is where you turn the corner though.
 - Yeah.
 - It gets hot right there.
 - A different...
 - Yeah, it does.
 - A different vibe altogether.
 - Yeah.
 - And you know what, Dave?
 - Want one of my beers?
 Get some beer.
 - I got some.
 - Oh, you do?
 Buddy.
 You can do this, brother.
 - Whew, I got it.
 - I got you.
 - Yeah, Dave, I'm on the ride with you right now.
 Oops.
 (laughing)
 I just had a little spit up.
 Had a little spit up.
 Yeah, it's getting hot now.
 - Yeah, it is.
 Yeah, it is.
 So between the Sound City tour
 and then being a part-time member
 of the Taylor Hawkins Chevy Metal cover band,
 you have a lot of experience exploring the work
 of other legendary musicians.
 What do you learn by playing other people's music live?
 - So Taylor's band, Chevy Metal,
 has this awesome list of cover songs.
 One of them being "Turning Japanese."
 ♪ Turning Japanese ♪
 ♪ I think I'm turning Japanese ♪
 ♪ I really think so ♪
 And you listen to it on the radio,
 and you're like (humming)
 And then you play it on guitar,
 you're like, "Oh my God, this is so fucking hard."
 I remember once trying to play "Message in a Bottle,"
 and I fucking pulled a muscle in my hand
 playing a police song.
 I was like, "How do the police do this
 "without hurting themselves?"
 Like some people, some musicians,
 you sit there and you talk, and you're like,
 "Yeah, yeah, what's up?"
 But then you put on instruments and you start playing,
 and you actually get to know the person better
 without words, with instruments,
 because everyone does it differently.
 It's pretty rad.
 - You're, by the way, Lordesque.
 - Come on now.
 - I'm not just saying that.
 - Come on.
 - Dom is coming in 'cause she sees tears coming out
 of my eyes.
 - No, I'm good.
 - And yeah, Dave, you are good.
 You are good.
 - Really?
 - Yeah, this is--
 - Come on, let's do another shot.
 - All right.
 Let's do the damn thing.
 - Where's that fucking whiskey, motherfuckers?
 I mean, yes, it's hot.
 Okay, it's hot.
 I'm gonna chill it for you.
 - Yeah.
 - Since you're burning up so hot.
 - Thank you, Dave.
 ♪ Burning up, burning up for your lover ♪
 ♪ You burn it ♪
 Okay.
 That's gonna help.
 - Yeah, you're right.
 - Or not.
 - Well, you know what?
 We're just on this ride.
 - You're gonna make it, dude.
 Promise.
 - Well, that gave me all the confidence I need.
 Cheers.
 - 'Cause I was fucking kidding.
 (laughing)
 - Mommy, will you pass the poker, boy?
 - It's a fucking what?
 It's hot?
 - Yeah.
 But nothing Dave Grohl can't handle.
 Choking out the whole damn lineup.
 Choking out the whole damn lineup.
 - So you've been a self-described UFO nerd for decades
 and I'm curious how that interest peaked.
 I've heard you reference the 1987 best-selling book
 "Above Top Secret" by Timothy Good.
 - Yeah.
 When I was a kid, I had a lot of UFO dreams
 and like really, I'm a crazy vivid dreamer still to this day.
 Like I remember the music in my dream from last night.
 Like every fucking day I wake up, I remember my dreams.
 And when I was a kid, I would have these awesome UFO dreams
 where like I'd be lying in my front yard
 in Springfield, Virginia,
 and I'd be staring up at the stars and I'm like, wow.
 And then I realized like, oh my God, it's not the stars.
 It's the underside of this mirror fucking glass shaped
 ship thing and that was taking me to space.
 So I always thought that UFOs were kind of real
 and I convinced all my friends in my neighborhood
 that I was a UFO expert and they'd be like,
 come over to my yard.
 I think I saw a UFO last night.
 And I'd walk over to their yard and be like,
 yeah, see that like discolored grass right there?
 That might be a crop circle or whatever.
 So from an early age, I was super into UFOs.
 I read this book "Above Top Secret" and in that,
 I saw the term Foo Fighters and here we are.
 You wanna hit the shit right now?
 - Yeah, of course.
 Let's go, we're rocking.
 - You sure?
 - Yeah.
 - Did you see his face?
 - The laugh in the back.
 - That's not real.
 - Yeah, I demand another shot.
 I insist on another shot.
 - If you say so.
 (laughing)
 Last shot.
 - Last shot.
 - Fuck that shit, it ain't the last shot.
 - Last wing.
 - Last wing?
 Drink that.
 - All right, cheers Dave.
 - God damn it, Sean.
 I mean, I gotta be honest.
 I'm not kidding, dude.
 When I was a kid, I learned to love music
 watching Saturday Night Live.
 And I walked onto that set for the first time in 1992,
 like, holy shit, I'm here.
 As a teenager, I fucking watched the David Letterman show
 every fucking night as I did bong hit after bong hit
 after bong hit.
 (laughing)
 - Some parallels.
 - And I fucking walked onto that fucking stage,
 I'm like, oh my God, I'm here.
 For years, I've watched this fucking show
 and I finally walked onto this set
 and saw those sauces and saw your face.
 I was like, yes!
 Bucket list, bam!
 The only thing I have left to do in my life
 is jam with AC/DC.
 Yeah!
 - Dave, I can't handle that.
 I don't know how to process that.
 - I'm just saying.
 - That.
 - Are we hitting the last dab, what are we doing?
 - Let's fucking hit this last dab.
 Let's hit a fucking last shot.
 - Let's put the dab on.
 Let's put the dab on, I got the dab on.
 - Hold on a second.
 - Let's talk about love.
 - All right.
 - I was kidding.
 (laughing)
 One more shot.
 - One more shot, yeah.
 One more shot, one more wing.
 Let's do a shot, we'll chase it with the wing.
 - Ooh, wing chaser.
 - Wing chaser.
 Or shot chaser, depending on how you wanna line it up.
 - You know what I gotta do fucking tomorrow?
 I gotta go to Narnia.
 - What?
 - I gotta go to Narnia.
 - What's in Narnia?
 - Narnia business.
 (laughing)
 Come on now.
 - Well, you know what, I almost think it would be like,
 silly to ask a wing 10 question.
 Let's eat this wing.
 Let's eat this wing, Dave.
 - Okay.
 - And what a ride it's been.
 - Yeah, man.
 Did you put a dab on it?
 - I did.
 - You hit it, right?
 - I hit that shit, I hit that shit.
 - I've got a confession to make.
 - I got a confession to make.
 - Come on, I wasn't gonna fucking say it like that.
 Just so you know,
 I have this shit at home.
 Sometimes I come home from rehearsal.
 Did that sound like Elvis?
 Did you hear what I just said?
 (laughing)
 Sometimes I come home from rehearsal,
 I drink a couple beers,
 and eat a teaspoon of this shit.
 So you know what?
 Hot ones.
 I got your ass.
 Taken on the wings of death, choking out the gauntlet,
 living to tell the tale,
 and still making his rehearsal tonight at 6 p.m.
 And now Dave Gold, there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, or this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 (singing)
 (singing)
 Got a horror movie coming out.
 How about that shit?
 And then I'm in a band called The Food Fighters,
 we're gonna play a bunch of shows,
 and then fucking, you know.
