 I'm telling you, my face doesn't feel like my face.
 ♪ I can feel my face when I'm with you ♪
 Literally, literally.
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Millie Bobby Brown.
 She's an actress and producer you know best
 from her role as Eleven on the seven time
 Emmy Award winning global mega hit show,
 Stranger Things, which returns for its highly anticipated
 fourth season on Netflix May 27th.
 Millie Bobby Brown, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you very much.
 I'm very excited to be here.
 - Well, how are you around spicy food?
 I know that the macads that you eat on set
 from Crafty Dave, you like to hit them
 with a little hot sriracha.
 - I do, I do.
 I was also born in Spain,
 so I'm very familiar with spicier foods,
 but I'm quite nervous in all honesty.
 It's very nerve wracking.
 (upbeat music)
 - Can I ask you a question?
 - Anything you want.
 - If I drink this, does it mean I've given up?
 - No, no, no.
 You know, we want it to be like the most comfortable,
 least comfortable interview, if that makes sense.
 So if you need some milkshake.
 - Why does it already smell spicy?
 My nostrils, like I have no more hairs left.
 Okay, where are we starting?
 - At the handle over here with the classic garlic Fresno.
 So to your, yep, perfect.
 - Okay.
 - Do we have a little surprise here
 to open things up for wing one?
 - We do have a surprise.
 - Wow. - Noah.
 - Hello. - Noah.
 - I'm glad to be here.
 - On the spot giving us a little assist here for wing one.
 - So this is the mild one?
 - Yep.
 You lucked out, you picked a good time to come in.
 - Cheers, Noah.
 - Really good wing.
 - No, by the way, she was saying that she's so good at spice.
 - I know, we'll find out today.
 - I'm much better with spice.
 - Well, they didn't invite you on.
 - But I'm happy to be here for the interview.
 - It's not spicy, is it?
 All right, now go watch me kill this.
 There we go.
 - I love you. - Got the support,
 hitting the milkshake.
 - Love you, guys. - Great job, Noah.
 Let's give Noah a hand right there.
 So the scene is set for the season four premiere
 of "Stranger Things," which the Duffer brothers
 have ominously described as being the show's
 Game of Thrones season.
 What made shooting this season, in your words,
 the hardest one you've ever filmed?
 - I mean, mostly because we filmed for three years,
 especially with the amount of filming that we had to do.
 We were filming in three different places.
 We were filming in Lithuania, New Mexico, and Atlanta,
 and it was difficult.
 Yeah, I think that's, yeah.
 - How's that first wing?
 - Fine.
 - Doing great. - Yeah.
 - Are you ready to move on here to the next wing?
 - Yes.
 - This right here is the adobo loco wing sauce,
 a little bit of like an island vibe with this one.
 - Okay.
 Nice, really nice.
 - So "Stranger Things" isn't the only big project
 that you have on the way with "Enola Holmes 2"
 coming out soon, a sequel to the acclaimed 2020 film
 that you not only starred in, but also produced.
 Between the writing, the casting,
 and all the different aspects of a production,
 was there anything that you found felt most natural to you
 or where you felt you could make the biggest impact
 as a producer?
 - Producing felt really natural to me
 because I could still create on and off camera.
 So I could, you know, go onto set and do my thing,
 but also creatively change the script and go into editing.
 And it was a really cool position
 and it actually made me feel the most comfortable I've felt
 in any set situation because I felt like I could,
 I don't know, express myself fully in my creative process.
 - From Gothic Victorian dresses
 to school uniform disguises, pound for pound,
 what do you think was the best fit
 in the whole "Enola Holmes" project
 from a pure costume design perspective?
 - I love my red dress.
 I think my red dress is really cool
 and it symbolizes, you know, this masculine, kick-ass girl
 who knows her jujitsu, but also can cut,
 see when she needs to.
 I think it's really sweet.
 Is this one?
 - It gets a little, it gets a little...
 (upbeat music)
 A little more real here.
 - Yep, I'm feeling it.
 - Was there anything that you found interesting
 or amusing about learning the Midwest accent
 for "Stranger Things"?
 I ask because I'm from Illinois.
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.
 - What I will say is that the Duffer brothers
 who created the show definitely have that kind of accent.
 They're not like whiny,
 but they definitely say y'all and things like that.
 Do you say y'all?
 - No, I don't say y'all, but like, you know, also like milk.
 You know, like sometimes I feel like guests can hear
 the drawl coming from me.
 And then they're like, "Well, where are you from?"
 And I'm like, "Illinois."
 And then they're like, "Of course."
 - We know why.
 - Are there British accents
 that you think should get more play in Hollywood?
 - I love a Liverpudlian accent.
 Anyone from Liverpool, it sounds,
 I can't do the accents of "Don't Ask Me."
 - I won't, I won't.
 - But I support the football team, Liverpool,
 and they have a really-
 - Big FA Cup win, by the way, the other day.
 - Yeah, I know.
 We're very proud.
 I love a Liverpudlian accent.
 What is this flavor?
 - This is like a serrano pepper kind of green sauce.
 - Oh, that one's nice.
 - You like that one?
 There we go.
 - I do like that one.
 Am I getting progressively shinier?
 - No.
 - Yeah, you have the nice Hot Ones glow
 that we like to see at this point in the show.
 So when we had Rob Lowe on the show,
 he described eating on camera
 as being one of the most difficult actor tricks of all time.
 What are the forces at play
 that make shooting a scene in which your character
 is wolfing down diner food or Eggo waffles by the dozen?
 What makes those scenes for an actor
 so much more difficult than an audience may realize?
 - Because you're doing it for 12 hours.
 So usually what you do is you just get
 a little bucket beside you,
 and you can just spit into it after every take
 or sometimes during the take.
 But most of the time I just go,
 and then just pretend I'm eating,
 which always kind of works.
 But other than that, yeah,
 you just start to feel really nauseous.
 It's horrible.
 And whatever you choose to eat on that plate,
 you're eating for 12 hours.
 So usually I always choose like a salad or a fruit.
 It works.
 - And then on the topic,
 we talked about one of your favorite snacks, the macad.
 What is a macad?
 And can you talk me through how to make one
 if I wanted to try it for myself?
 - Oh yes.
 Okay, so what we do is we get a piece of lettuce
 and we get cut up, ham, peppers,
 and then we get sriracha
 and we cover the whole kind of sandwich in it.
 And then they usually make me like six of them.
 And that is what keeps me going on set.
 It's the best ever.
 With no bread. - Fueled by macads.
 - Fueled.
 Yeah, and I think it's the last name
 of the guy who makes it.
 That's why we call it a macad.
 - Crafty Dave.
 - Crafty Dave.
 - Shout out to Crafty Dave.
 All right, you are doing so good by the way.
 - Thank you.
 - We are to the halfway point.
 Are you ready to move on here to number five?
 - Yeah.
 - So this is the seventh Reaper here at five.
 - That one's also nice.
 It's nice.
 I like it.
 - Here we go.
 - I'm feeling pretty good.
 God, I thought this would be a lot worse than I thought.
 - Well.
 - Do you start to feel it?
 Do you start to feel it soon?
 - It does get a little crazier in the back half,
 but you are crushing this.
 - Okay, good.
 - You're absolutely crushing this.
 - I'm not saying that I'm not feeling it,
 but it's not making me want to cry like Tom Holland.
 Is that bad?
 Okay, good.
 - We haven't even hit the milkshakes yet.
 - I know.
 Can we, can I try it?
 - Sure, sure.
 I'm just wanting to try it.
 - Oh, this is good.
 Where did we get this from?
 Five Guys.
 - Five Guys.
 - Also, why do Five Guys not put their chips in a thing?
 They always just put it in the bag, don't they?
 - Oh, right, right, yeah.
 Just the fries just hanging loose in the bag.
 - And also, why are there peanuts in there?
 Like, who eats peanuts?
 Anyways, all right.
 - All right, Millie, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 What was the highlight of the afternoon
 you spent ripping laps with Lewis Hamilton
 at the Circuit of America?
 - I got to do a hot lap with him.
 - Oh.
 - Little tease.
 - Yeah, it was a spin-off.
 - And we got to go around the racetrack,
 and it was amazing.
 It was a really cool experience.
 Very terrifying.
 Almost as terrifying as this one, but it was really cool.
 And this moment was when we were about to get in the car.
 So you see I'm a bit nervous.
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - But then just like this show,
 you get down in the seat and then you just own it, right?
 - You've got to, you've got to.
 No one's taking me down.
 - All right, up next for you.
 Besides Godzilla actually being a tennis ball
 you're delivering lines to,
 what blew your mind most about the technical wizardry
 that goes into making a kaiju blockbuster?
 - It's insane.
 It's insane.
 It also takes longer to put Godzilla in there
 than to actually film it.
 They are so unbelievably talented in that field
 that they can, you know, it was,
 he was literally a tennis ball.
 I remember my neck hurting
 'cause I was always looking up in that film.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 - Oh my God, I'm nervous now.
 You were telling me that I've got four more left.
 I just didn't get enough.
 - There you go.
 - I don't want anyone to think I've whipped out.
 (laughing)
 - So one of the unique elements of Stranger Things
 is it seems like you and your cast mates
 have been given a deal of creative input
 even from a young age.
 Is there an example of an 11 character trade
 or Stranger Things plot point
 that you're proudest to have fought for
 or put your fingerprints on in some way?
 - Yeah, I think this season that I feel that the most,
 like with the bullying aspect of what 11's going through,
 I feel really proud to represent that kind of storyline
 because that's a very real thing.
 People do deal with that in school.
 And I think, you know, it's a hard thing to film for sure,
 especially from someone who has gone through bullying.
 But yeah, I just feel,
 I feel really proud to have done that.
 - How would you grade Hollywood's ability
 to harness young people's creativity these days?
 Because people have gone from being, you know, just actors
 to now all of a sudden being like show runners
 and executive producers at younger and younger ages.
 - Yeah, I mean, we're getting there.
 We are getting there.
 I think that we have amazing corporations,
 say like Netflix and Legendary,
 who have given me opportunities to produce
 and to be part of my projects collaboratively,
 not only as a young person, but a young girl.
 I think those types of things are getting the ball rolling
 and pushing society to trust Gen Z
 and all that we have to offer.
 It's not really psyching me out.
 Do you know what it feels like?
 Have you ever gotten a CT scan?
 - I have, I have, I have actually had one CT scan.
 - And they put the dye in you.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - That's what it feels like.
 Your body just kind of gets all warm.
 (laughing)
 It's fun.
 - So one of the hallmarks of Stranger Things
 is 80s nostalgia, which has given life
 through this meticulous commitment to period pieces,
 to period details.
 What's the first thing that comes--
 - You seem to be choking up a bit here.
 - Listen.
 - I haven't just beat you on your own show, have I?
 - Listen, it happens every once in a while.
 I'm but a humble chicken wing talk show host.
 - That's all right, that's all right.
 - I'm just out here trying my best.
 (laughing)
 - We appreciate that.
 - What's the first thing that comes to mind
 when you think about the obsessive level of detail
 that went into a set piece
 to keep it authentic to the period?
 - Ooh, we use a lot of helicopters in our show.
 We have to be like, we have to get a helicopter
 that's basically from the 80s.
 I think that's insane.
 That also goes up in the sky, do you know what I mean?
 - Right, that can still do it.
 - Yeah, that can still do it.
 Or they have to paint it
 to absolutely replicate an 80s helicopter.
 I think that's pretty impressive to me.
 - The mall to me was impressive.
 - Oh, the mall is, I mean, that attention to detail,
 the fact that it wasn't called Gap
 and it was called The Gap.
 Like certain things like that, I'm like, wow,
 that's just, it's really cool.
 All the clothes were from the 80s.
 They all had tags on it from the 80s.
 Like it was all very, very nostalgic
 for my family, my parents, and not really for me at all,
 but it was really cool to be in it.
 It felt like you were really in it.
 - And then I understand that, you know,
 part of the requisite homework was watching movies
 like The Goonies or Poltergeist or Stand By Me.
 Did you walk away from that experience
 with a film in particular that meant the most to you?
 - I love E.T.
 E.T. reminds me of Eleven a lot because, you know,
 E.T. is this kind of thing that's come down
 from a different planet.
 It kind of feels like Eleven's come down
 from this different planet,
 doesn't know anyone and trusts Elliot.
 And I think Eleven trusts Mike and it's quite a nice,
 you know, that's quite a nice resemblance.
 - All right, so this next one is Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 A sauce that's reputation precedes it just a little bit.
 - Okay.
 - All right, and then this is one that's like a prank,
 but you're crushing it.
 - What do you mean like a prank?
 (dramatic music)
 - This one is just worse.
 - There's just something about this one.
 (dramatic music)
 (coughing)
 - I know.
 (coughing)
 (coughing)
 - That's not even normal.
 - No, nothing about it, nothing about it.
 - That like made me want to stop breathing.
 - Just hit that milkshake.
 - I did so fucking well.
 - You're still doing well.
 You're still crushing it.
 - Oh no.
 - You're still doing good.
 - No.
 (laughing)
 - Just ask me a question.
 - Okay, sure, sure.
 You know, it's not every day that we have a Hot Ones guess
 with their very own eyewear line.
 What to you is like fundamental or key
 when pulling out a perfect pair of spectacles or shades?
 - What one did Tom Holland cry at?
 - At this one, this one.
 - I just need an ice cube in my mouth.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Well, I really like cat eye sunglasses.
 It's on my gums.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Tongue, lips, everything.
 - My hair is falling out.
 (laughing)
 I really like cat eye shapes.
 - Well, if you'll humor me, what I wanna do
 is show you some pictures
 from iconic celebrity's sunglass moments from the past.
 I'm just curious how they hit your expert eye.
 You know, the things that are working for you,
 the things that don't work for you.
 And we'll start with Elton John.
 Do you have any thoughts?
 - Why did you do this to me?
 I'm only 18.
 I'm only small.
 - Do you have any thoughts on these shades
 from Elton John's pinball wizard?
 - Yeah, they're so great.
 (laughing)
 I love them.
 - What about this?
 Thumbs up or thumbs way up on Missy Elliott's
 super duper fly crystal mask look?
 - I love them.
 They're great.
 I love them.
 (laughing)
 - All right, next, up next.
 - Why is it not getting better though?
 - I know, I know.
 It's just gonna grow a little bit.
 Do you have a preference between the risky business?
 - I don't like neither.
 They don't look nice.
 I don't like those ones.
 They don't suit me.
 - There we go.
 One more for you before we go.
 Last but not least, your thoughts on Lady Gaga
 at the 2019 Met Gala.
 - Yep, it was a lovely look by her.
 I don't think I can do more.
 Is that one worse?
 Don't try and talk me through this.
 Tell me right now.
 Is that ninth one bad?
 - It's not worse than the last one.
 - Is it gonna make what I'm feeling right now though,
 the after effect of that one?
 You led me into that.
 I don't think I'll ever trust you again.
 (dramatic music)
 - No, it's already burning my nose.
 - Whoa.
 - What do you mean whoa?
 - No, I just like the determination.
 - I know, I know.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 (laughing)
 - I wanna do this.
 - You got it.
 - I'm telling you, my face doesn't feel like my face.
 ♪ I can feel my face when I'm with you ♪
 Literally, literally.
 Oh my God.
 We got it, we got it.
 So I know that you have a spiritual connection with whales,
 one saying that they symbolize you as a person.
 To quote, "They're loud and they're queens of the sea."
 Is there a whale fun fact or quality that you see in whales
 that you see most in yourself?
 - Humpback whales.
 Humpback whales float and eat all day.
 Girls, and they all like to be girls.
 That one isn't good.
 - Yeah, I know, I know.
 Do you want some ice cubes?
 - No, yes.
 - Here we go, look it.
 You want it, we got it.
 - Thank you, ma'am.
 (laughing)
 - There we go.
 There we go.
 From your unique perspective, Godzilla,
 destructive and rampaging sea monster
 or misunderstood environmental activist?
 - Misunderstood environmental activist.
 Cheers to that.
 - You don't have to if you don't want to.
 - No.
 Why are you doing it?
 You don't have to prove anything, you're great.
 You're great, you're doing great.
 - Yeah, you know what, you're right.
 I don't have to prove anything.
 - No, you don't.
 - You know, I think I'm so mechanical
 in just going through this all the time
 that I don't stop to think about--
 - Yourself.
 Think about yourself.
 - Do I need for me to like spike the ball
 in the end zone or whatever?
 - No, you don't, no, you don't.
 - All right, well, you're right.
 I'm gonna pop the top on this.
 - You're doing great, you're doing great.
 - But I'm not gonna damn it.
 - Tell me about your life.
 (laughing)
 - From Illinois 70 years ago.
 - Did you have kids?
 - No kids.
 - No kids, you don't want kids?
 - All right, now I'm mentally
 and emotionally younger than you.
 I know.
 - If I throw up, will you be there for me?
 - I'm here for you always.
 We're forever bonded, all right?
 - We will.
 - We're forever bonded by the wigs of death here.
 Yep, you got it, you got it.
 And the good news here, Millie.
 - We're done, I know, I know.
 - I don't need you to talk anymore.
 I don't need you to talk, yeah.
 Stranger Things executive producer and director,
 Sean Levy, he once said that you're able
 to convey more without a word
 than many actors convey with monologues.
 So to close things out, I'll point to a hot sauce.
 You just react to what it was like to eat that hot sauce.
 Clearly in a facial expression.
 - Sure.
 - The one that we just ate, the last ab.
 - That.
 - Oh, how about this one that you really liked?
 Los Calientes Verde.
 And then how about the one that almost made you
 write me off forever, Devon Beyond Insanity?
 - That's what my insides were doing.
 - Not a dry eye in the house.
 And look at you, Millie Bobby Brown,
 taking on the wings of death and living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Guys, my lips.
 At least I'm gonna have like Kylie Jenner lips.
 All right, I'm just gonna live with it.
 Guys, what's Stranger Things season four?
 - It just feels like everything needs to be talked
 a lot slower.
 - Yeah, we just gotta, you know,
 we gotta take these times and just chill it out
 a little bit, right?
 - Will you just promo the show?
 - Stranger Things, May 27th, season four.
 The show must be good 'cause she's here
 eating scorching hot chicken wings.
 - Thank you so much for having me here.
 (audience applauding)
 - Yeah, that's the hot ones experience.
 - I had so much fun.
 - Yeah, yeah, come on in, come on in.
 You did it, you did so good.
 - So much.
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
 Thank you so much for watching today's video.
