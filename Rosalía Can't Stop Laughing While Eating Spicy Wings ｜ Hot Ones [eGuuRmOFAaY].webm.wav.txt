 I know, I'm right here.
 ¡Dios mío!
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Rosalía.
 She's a two-time Grammy Award winning artist and producer coming off an incredible year
 that included a 15-country world tour and the release of Moto Mami,
 the album with the highest Metacritic rating of all of 2022.
 And exciting news, she has new music out as well.
 Her EP with Raul Alejandro is called RR and it's available now.
 Rosalía, welcome to the show.
 Thank you so much.
 How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 I'm not familiar with it.
 Yeah, this is not something that I have at home.
 So I'm not really familiarized with it, to be honest.
 Well, today you'll get a full crash course.
 Are you ready to get started?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Let's do it.
 Oh my God, oh my God, okay.
 Classic hot sauce.
 Let's see what it's all about.
 It tastes nice.
 It's not spicy.
 It's more maple and chili.
 So after a pair of more serious albums, I know that you were excited to unleash your
 playfulness and sense of humor from Moto Mami.
 How did your approach to making an album change once you decided to unlock that side of yourself?
 I really think that that's my, I don't know, my main goal in life is just to be as free
 as possible.
 So I think that music is a reflection of who you are.
 So if you're free, then the music is free.
 And so I was like, yeah, let me try to just have fun when I do this, this project, Moto
 Mami.
 And I'm a huge fan of the album.
 I haven't been able to stop listening to it for like a week and excuse the pronunciation,
 but like your song So Go, right?
 That opens up.
 Yeah.
 And it has this like little jazz piano thing.
 How do you think about blending the contemporary with the traditional in your art?
 The tradition is just, it's just the foundation.
 In order to create, in order to do something, you have to know what it's been done.
 So I think that, yeah, the classics are something that I learned to love because the masters
 I had, I had different masters.
 I still have masters.
 And that's what classics are for.
 I think to look back, to know where you come from, to know where you're going.
 Curri Verde, okay.
 I like it.
 There we go.
 Two for two.
 Yeah, I like it.
 You're a hot sauce person all along.
 No.
 Yeah.
 All along.
 You think so?
 I think so.
 That's the two first ones.
 Let's see the other.
 Let's see.
 It's not bad.
 There you go.
 How cook this?
 They did it good.
 Yeah, yeah.
 The wings are kicking today.
 Dom, you did good.
 Dom, you did good.
 Dom, thank you so much.
 Yeah.
 It's a little bit more spicy now.
 Yeah, right, right.
 When you start talking a little bit, sometimes it kind of unlocks it there.
 It's more spicy after.
 They build a little bit.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So unlike a lot of breakout stars, you actually have a decade of formal music training, studying
 at academies like the Catalonia College of Music, which helped to inform your first album.
 We asked Lizzo this question, but I'm curious your perspective.
 How did studying classic music theory, how did it affect the way that you approach making
 hits now?
 Knowing theory, it just allowed me to whatever I had in my head, I was able to materialize
 it.
 I was able to write it.
 I was able to, okay, let me read this how somebody else, again, the classics, how somebody
 else thought of writing a song.
 And then it allowed me to understand better the possibilities in using chords.
 It allowed me so many things, understanding better the melodies, the intervals, the options.
 It's just knowledge.
 I remember somebody said knowledge, sometimes it may not allow you to be so creative.
 It may be it makes your creativity be less expansive, but I think it's the opposite.
 I think it's lo opuesto.
 I think the more knowledge you have, the more freedom you're going to have, I think.
 Lemon.
 I like lemon.
 It's gentle.
 There we go.
 I'm trying to just keep up with you over here.
 I think it's fine.
 There we go.
 You like all three of them, it seems like, so far.
 Yeah.
 There we go.
 There we go.
 I thought it was going to be much worse.
 Well, you know, we got a ways to go.
 We got a ways to go.
 I'm going to be honest with you.
 All right.
 All right.
 So understand that during your years of training, you'd work as an autonomous singer for hire,
 doing wedding gigs or doing performances at restaurants where you were paid a little
 over 80 euros or an exchange for dinner.
 Yes.
 Did you have a favorite local tablao to perform at?
 I definitely loved one, but it was the most special because it was the only one, I think
 maybe, that was a bar where some jazz people would play too, but also flamenco.
 It would be like traditional, like rigor con rigor, like amazing traditional flamenco.
 And that was called Yassi.
 Yassi in Barcelona.
 Yassi, yeah.
 Yeah, I remember that man.
 He would be like, this is the flamenco cathedral.
 I used to feel nervous before going on stage, but I remember that that builds me as a como
 cantaora.
 If I was performing in a restaurant, it would be a challenge because they didn't go to see
 you perform.
 Right.
 They go there to eat.
 So it's a challenge.
 And I would be very like, I'll be like, no, no, no, no.
 They're going to hear me tonight.
 Yeah.
 They're going to listen to what I'm doing.
 They're going to be like, no, no, I don't care about the food.
 Let me hear this, you know?
 So that would be also something that would taught me so much.
 Because it's really, it's really tough.
 I really respect people who do that.
 People who perform in clubs, who perform in restaurants, who perform in weddings, who
 perform in parties.
 Like it's just, it's hard.
 It's a challenge and you have to be very, very strong psychologically, I think.
 Mmm, chocolate. I like chocolate.
 I can feel the chocolate.
 Yeah.
 Coming through a little bit.
 This is spicy.
 Yeah.
 This one I knew.
 Yeah.
 I'm leaving.
 This is spicy.
 Yeah.
 Do you like it though at all?
 No, not at all.
 Not at all.
 It's disturbing.
 Yeah.
 Like spicy, like it's disturbing.
 Uncomfortable.
 Uncomfortable.
 Walls closing in here on this interview.
 There we go.
 There we go.
 It's happening.
 The hot ones experience.
 This is it.
 Do you have a favorite classic art reference from one of your music videos?
 You know, from Frida Kahlo to Botticelli to Francisco Goya.
 You know, you see these masterpieces of the past echoed throughout your work.
 I like all of the ones you said.
 You do?
 I love classics.
 Yeah.
 I love Pedro Almodóvar.
 His movies are really amazing.
 I love Pedro.
 I love...
 Monét is amazing.
 And his paintings relax me.
 Every time I see a Monét painting, I think it's my favorite.
 Paintings can be inspiring to write a song.
 Movies can be inspiring to write a song.
 I think anything can be an excuse.
 I don't know if this is inspiring to write a song, but...
 But it might shake something loose.
 It might shake something, yeah.
 It's spicy in my lips.
 Going forward, you know, with every new wing, there will be a new thing.
 Okay.
 You know?
 Like, my throat is itching a little bit.
 My lips are numb.
 My tongue feels like ice in my mouth, you know?
 No ice.
 All of those different things.
 No ice.
 No ice.
 But you're doing great.
 Si.
 You're doing great.
 Yeah, it's fine.
 Okay, I thought it was worse.
 I think the chocolate one I liked better, the taste of it, but it was more hot.
 Yeah, it left behind a little bit of a trail, right?
 Yeah.
 Exactly, exactly.
 Your albums have incredible drum production on them.
 Oh, thank you.
 What are super aggressive drums, and then why were they important for you when you were conceptualizing Motomami?
 I love that you asked that.
 I think that drums gives a lot of energy.
 And I wanted that Motomami would be like a roller coaster.
 That was a clear intention.
 And then I was like, drums can give me the aggressive...aggressiveness?
 That's how you call it, right? Aggressiveness?
 Yeah.
 The aggressiveness that I wanted to achieve, I could get with drums.
 In orchestral music, literally when they use the drums, it makes it just more violent, more aggressive.
 Personally, I really love these type of drums.
 Like drums of fire, like this.
 Yeah, well speaking of drums.
 Right here.
 Oh my God.
 This next one...
 Okay.
 Is...
 Spicy Shark.
 It's spicy.
 Cardamom.
 Garlic.
 That smells good.
 Yeah, it smells good.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh my God.
 It tastes good.
 Yeah, but pretty hot.
 This is my favorite.
 There we go.
 This is my favorite.
 Yeah.
 It's super spicy though.
 I was just about to say.
 Yeah, it's very spicy.
 I was just about to say.
 These are my favorite anymore.
 Yeah, I was just about to say.
 I was like, when I bit that wing, I was like, "Whoa, this one's pretty hot."
 And then when you're like, "This is my favorite one."
 No.
 I was like, "Really?"
 No.
 But...
 I just like that beginning.
 Oh my God, this is bad.
 This is really bad.
 You strike me as a sentimental person.
 Of all the instruments that you own, is there one that stands out for the backstory or its history?
 Maybe the cajon that I have.
 There's this Peruvian instrument that I love.
 It is like a box.
 It's getting harder to talk.
 Yeah, that's the show.
 That's the show.
 It's getting hard to talk.
 My tongue feels like it's a comodormida.
 Okay, a box.
 And it's very beautiful how it sounds.
 And I remember I used to play this instrument in San Esteban, where I come from, this little town.
 And when I go to my mom's house and I see that, it always melts my...
 It's like inside.
 This is so bad.
 I know, I know.
 But you got it.
 It's getting worse.
 But it'll get better.
 And then we'll move on to the next wing and it'll get worse again.
 But...
 This is bad.
 This is bad.
 I know, I know.
 I got you.
 I got you.
 I got you.
 It tricked me.
 How do you say it?
 Me engaño.
 What does that mean?
 Me engaño.
 It fooled me in the beginning.
 I was like, "Oh, this tastes sweet or something."
 Yeah, that's what I got.
 When I smelled it, I was like, "This is one of the better smelling hot sauces I've ever caught a whiff of."
 But spicy.
 The milk hug.
 The spicy wing.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to join you at the milk party.
 Milk party, sí.
 I like better than milk party.
 Yeah, this one really fucked me up.
 It fucked me up.
 That just works.
 That just works.
 Yeah, this one.
 I regret that I came here.
 I'm starting to regret it.
 If I had a dollar for every time I heard that.
 Really?
 People say that, no?
 I'd have like 60 bucks.
 All right.
 I'm going to go.
 What was important to you when working with designer Dion Lee for the outfits for your latest tour?
 I imagine that it was probably challenging to come up with something that had the motorcycle aesthetic,
 but that you could also move around in and dance in.
 Yeah.
 It actually is always a challenge every time trying to figure out clothes for a performance.
 And I wish that it was much easier because it's usually a disaster.
 Coming up with clothes for a performance.
 Yeah.
 It's usually a disaster.
 It's usually, you know, like you have to deal with shoes that maybe, I don't know, you cannot do a spin with it.
 I don't know, like maybe you're showing a boob.
 Things like that.
 That can happen, right.
 These things can happen.
 So yeah, you have to figure it out and it's always a process and everything.
 But yeah, I feel very grateful that all the people that helped me through all these years took me on stage and not being naked.
 My lips hurt, but it's okay.
 It feels like somebody, like I just got into a fight.
 Somebody punched me here.
 Literally.
 That's how it feels.
 This one's fucked up.
 Okay.
 It's me being honest with you.
 Okay.
 Okay, here we go.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 This is bad.
 Yeah.
 It's so bad.
 I know and it just doesn't stop.
 I know.
 I know.
 I know.
 But what you're doing today is very brave.
 It's very brave.
 Never eating hot sauce before and then coming in here and eating maybe the hottest hot sauce in the world.
 It's so bad.
 Fuck.
 I know.
 I know.
 It's painful.
 Yeah.
 No, I get it.
 I get it.
 I get it 100%.
 I understand.
 I relate.
 This is really inconvenient.
 This taste is so bad.
 Right.
 It's so bad.
 And then just be careful around the eyes.
 Be careful around the eyes.
 I'm right with you.
 I'm right with you.
 When J Balvin was on the show, he taught me how to say "pecante hasta la chimba."
 Exactly.
 Isn't there a Spanish slang that you can teach me to say that a dish is just like spicy as hell?
 I'm ready.
 I know.
 I'm right here.
 I'm right here.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my God.
 I don't even know how to say it.
 I don't know how to describe this.
 His fucking mother.
 Yeah, that's how I would say it.
 Yeah?
 Yeah.
 Fuck.
 Fuck.
 This is very...
 Yeah, this shit.
 I'm sweating.
 I know.
 I'm sweating.
 It's the hot one's glow that happens at this time of the show.
 Already glowing.
 My glow was perfect on point.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Till now though.
 It's never looked better.
 It's never looked better.
 And just in time.
 Because as we move on in the lineup, we're going to be joined by a very special guest.
 Oh my God, yes.
 I need help.
 I got you...
 What is this?
 Ice cream.
 No ice cream, thank you.
 He got the ice cream.
 I'm the ambulance.
 I'm the 911.
 Maybe you're the best boyfriend in the fucking planet.
 Alright.
 Coming with the ice cream.
 Raul Alejandro, yes.
 Coming with the ice cream.
 Long time partners in life.
 First time collaborators on the music side of things.
 So this one is the watermelon ghost in the 9th spot.
 He's sweating.
 I'm sweating.
 I'm sweating.
 I'm sweating.
 It's warm.
 I'm not sweating.
 Right, yeah.
 This is very strange.
 Like a fever or something.
 Yeah.
 Alright.
 Calm down.
 Oh my God, give me strength.
 Okay.
 Right?
 It's all good.
 I think after the last one.
 This is my job.
 He makes me laugh.
 There you go.
 I'm ready.
 He's here for the assist.
 I'm here ready.
 What a guy.
 What a guy.
 Maybe my God.
 What you need?
 More milk?
 I don't understand.
 I think it's so bad that it makes me laugh.
 Like it's crazy.
 I'm like, oh my God.
 It's making me cry in love.
 This is crazy.
 Oh my God.
 He's catching a little hot sauce head high.
 This is a disaster, absolutely.
 I never seen you like this before.
 Maybe we've been four years together.
 I swear, man, we've been four years together.
 I know, I know.
 I've never been through this.
 Well, it's great.
 You know, like after all these years and all the different experiences, you can still learn things about each other, you know?
 Exactly.
 We'll never have this at home.
 The Apollo.
 I like the name.
 Okay, you ready?
 Yeah.
 That's good?
 That's good.
 That is perfect.
 That was a perfect pour.
 That was a perfect pour.
 All right, I'm ready.
 He's got the ice cream standing by.
 Is it acid?
 I know, but the good news is it's all over.
 Yeah.
 Right through it.
 Not a spicy person.
 Today became one.
 And to close out the interview today, we're going to dust off an old Hot Ones classic.
 All right.
 This is the bucket of BFF questions.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So what we want you to do is each reach in there and pull out a question.
 And when you pull out a question, you ask the other person.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 The bomb.
 Yeah, I was scared about this one.
 I knew it.
 Can you believe my intuition?
 I knew your intuition.
 You were like beyond insanity.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Baby, what's the question?
 All right, what's the question?
 Okay.
 What's your favorite song of mine to watch me perform live?
 Right now Punto 40 I really like.
 Because you're dancing like, I don't know, like doing some like fire stuff.
 I really like it.
 Punto 40.
 Yeah, Punto 40.
 All right.
 Rosalia.
 Okay.
 Okay, let's go.
 Okay.
 Give me that.
 What's something new you learn about me creating?
 I'm releasing music together for the first time.
 Like, she likes like when she likes minimal stuff.
 So I'm more like, kind of like, like more stuff in the production.
 That's true.
 You're more Baroque.
 Yeah, more Baroque.
 And then she's more simple, more like clean and minimal.
 For me, it's kind of cool too, you know, just like I, so I learned.
 It's a different approach.
 I try to steal your sauce sometimes.
 You know, just doing my own way, but like, she's inspiring.
 Like, she inspired me a lot in music and in my personal life too.
 Thank you so much. You too.
 And can't steal her sauce today because look at the way she took on the wings of death.
 Lived to tell the tale.
 Not a hot sauce woman she walked in, but definitely a hot sauce woman now.
 And now there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 I'm eating Salsas del Infierno.
 And how it was? It was a disaster.
 And I think I never had a bad experience eating till this day.
 I always love eating, but not this time.
 Not today.
 No, sure, not today.
 But yeah, I can't wait to hit the stage again because I'm touring right now in festivals.
 So, get those tickets.
 Okay.
 Great job.
 Yes, I did it baby, I did it.
 I think it was exactly how I thought.
 Yeah.
 How I thought, like, I was like, it's probably going to be hard to handle at some point, but it's possible to handle.
 Like, it's like human, as a human, I can do it.
 Is this the spiciest meal you've ever eaten in your life?
 100%.
 Wow.
 100%.
 Never in my life I had this.
 And never again?
 No.
 I'm not doing it.
 I'm not doing it.
 Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
