 (dramatic music)
 - Ah.
 - Yeah.
 - I love the, I love milk.
 (clears throat)
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Sebastian Stan.
 He's an actor you know from his work
 as the Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
 I, Tonya, Political Animals, and many more.
 His latest projects though
 are the much buzzed about Pam and Tommy,
 currently streaming on Hulu,
 and his latest movie Fresh,
 which is set to release on March 4th, likewise on Hulu.
 Sebastian Stan, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you, man.
 Thank you, I'm thrilled to be here.
 - How would you gauge your level of comfort
 around spicy food as we get ready to start?
 - I don't know.
 I certainly haven't had a lot of spicy food in my life.
 This is probably gonna be the most of it right now.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 Okay, great.
 All right.
 Okay.
 That's pretty good.
 (dramatic music)
 So you play the role of motley crew drummer, Tommy Lee,
 in the new Hulu series, Pam and Tommy.
 In episode two, there's a scene in which Tommy
 is having this heartfelt state of the union
 with his own penis.
 Can you draw back the curtain on the mechanics
 of shooting something like that
 with animatronics and four puppeteers?
 - It was an event.
 I mean, there were cables and wires and men
 pressing buttons and directing.
 It was probably just about as awkward as it can get.
 Kind of like a fight scene, you know,
 in the sense that it needed to all be choreographed
 and stuff, but the core of the scene obviously
 is very sweet 'cause it's really about a man
 realizing he's falling in love with a woman.
 So he's in a confessional kind of state of mind.
 - Growing up, coming of age.
 - Yeah, more ways than one.
 (soft music)
 - A little more.
 - Yeah.
 But still nice.
 - There we go.
 - I think.
 I say before I regret.
 - So I'm cautious about how I talk about
 your latest film, "Fresh,"
 is I don't want to give away any of the secret,
 heinous plot points, but I do think that it's safe to say
 that it's maybe your most deliciously off the rails
 character to date.
 It's been a long time since I've seen an actor
 seemingly have so much fun playing an unhinged psychopath.
 What is it that you found cathartic
 about the role of Steve?
 - It was kind of like going down this weird rabbit hole
 of studying a lot of these serial killers.
 And I sort of stumbled on this Dr. Dorothy Lewis,
 who has a great documentary out right now
 called "Crazy Not Insane."
 And then I was able to reach out to her
 and talk to her and she kind of helped me
 put the whole thing together in a way.
 And I mean, it's just funny that we're talking about
 that movie over wings, but.
 - Yeah, actually.
 - It was.
 - You put that in my head now.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 But the idea was that sometimes these guys
 are so weirdly relatable.
 Ted Bundy was like a very charming guy.
 I mean, unfortunately that's what worked for him
 for a while.
 So it was just trying to kind of ground the character
 as much as possible and drawing from different
 serial killers in the past.
 - All right, Sebastian.
 Are you ready to move on here to the next wing?
 - Sure.
 - This one, the Clark and Hopkins Calabria.
 - Clark and Hopkins.
 Sounds like a couple of explorers.
 (laughing)
 That one's great.
 I think that one's like my favorite so far.
 - Reflecting on the 20 or so sets that were built
 for the 2015 Best Picture nominated film, The Martian,
 which one was the most jaw-dropping or impressive
 to actually see in person?
 - I think the facts that you have right now
 are pretty impressive.
 I'm like, I didn't know that.
 Well, look, Ridley Scott, I mean, that is just one
 of the greatest filmmakers of all time.
 And what was amazing about it is that he would shoot
 with like 10 cameras.
 And so in his, you know, the village where, you know,
 he sits at the monitors, he would just sort of sit there
 with these 3D glasses and he would have like five plasma
 screen TVs, all, you know, one for each camera.
 And the thing that that allows is that,
 and especially like we were shooting in the middle
 of a storm, you know, we're supposed to be
 in this sandstorm and it's, and literally you feel
 like you are in a storm.
 I mean, it was so immersive and it just,
 when he shoots with so many cameras, it just allows you
 to kind of like be in the scene a hundred percent.
 And that, and I was like, this is never gonna happen again.
 What distinguishes Darren Aronofsky's process
 as a director?
 You said of working on "Black Swan,"
 I had to not be scared of him.
 I just have this sort of scene between these two guys,
 you know, they go and they meet Mila Kunis
 and Natalie Portman.
 Actually that in itself was kind of a scary scene.
 I was like, we don't, we need to make sure we, you know,
 we show up, we know what we're doing here, you know,
 but he had a whole character breakdown written out
 for both of us.
 And it's just one scene in the movie.
 And you would think maybe that doesn't, you know,
 you just come on and it's okay.
 But he had a whole history of how we got there
 to that scene, what our whole emotional life was
 and just that level of specificity.
 I guess it's, I was really impressed with that.
 What would you say is the biggest difference
 between a fan who recognizes you on the street
 from your Marvel work and a fan who recognizes you
 from Gossip Girl?
 (laughing)
 Well, Gossip Girl, you know,
 they're very loyal to Gossip Girl fans.
 I mean, they really have to, you know,
 like they've loved the show, they've studied it,
 they have wild questions about that.
 I mean, it's just interesting to me how I still get that
 once in a while, but you really have to go dig
 to sort of find out about Gossip Girl,
 but their loyalty, yeah, that's a good one.
 (laughing)
 Let's see, the Phoenix.
 My God.
 Mm-hmm.
 Whoa.
 Ah, there it is.
 (laughing)
 You knew it was coming.
 I was waiting, I was reading, yeah.
 Yeah, just a subtle time bomb.
 (laughing)
 Ticking away.
 Okay.
 So in a 2020 interview with The Hollywood Reporter,
 you had some very insightful things to say about something
 that I don't think a lot of casual movie fans think about,
 and that's acting in the absence of dialogue.
 What do you see as the opportunity for an actor,
 or maybe what gets you most excited about doing a scene
 in which there's very little lines being spoken?
 I always think the audience is very smart.
 I just always think that, you know,
 'cause when you watch movies or you watch something
 you're always kind of more drawn, I think, I don't know,
 or I find myself more drawn to the person who does less,
 so to speak, you know, because we're always trying
 to kind of understand what's happening.
 And I think when you play a character that doesn't,
 that doesn't speak so much,
 then it just gives the audience more of an opportunity
 to kind of throw their own ideas and projections
 onto the character, and then I think they get
 more fascinated by that.
 Weirdly.
 But it's just also interesting sometimes
 because we don't often speak in life,
 and we communicate things even when we don't say anything,
 and sort of just that in itself
 might be more challenging sometimes.
 This Phoenix.
 Definitely crawling up my back.
 This one's all right.
 Back in a comfortable place.
 Exactly.
 I'm not drinking my milk until you are.
 Whoa, okay, so we're in a little bit of a standoff here.
 Well, I don't know.
 I mean, we'll see.
 I think like whole milk to put some hair back on your chest.
 All right, Sebastian, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 Okay.
 So we'll pull the picture over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Hmm.
 Can you explain the origin story of this stare down
 with the Iron Man mask and what ultimately became of it?
 Yes, this was on the set of Winter Soldier,
 and then they had that in a bag in the tent there.
 And I was like, I gotta take this picture,
 and then I gotta go send it to Kevin Feige
 and see what he thinks.
 And I didn't even know that he was doing Civil War
 at the time, so without knowing that that one day
 maybe I was gonna fight Iron Man.
 Seeing through the tea leaves.
 There's a crystal ball right there.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, or at least certainly hoping.
 Yeah.
 All right, up next.
 Oh, boy.
 Can you pull back the curtain on what it was like
 to attend the Stage Door Manor summer camp?
 I understand that Natalie Portman, Robert Downey Jr.,
 also alum.
 That's right, no, it's a great, it was a beautiful camp,
 and it's still there, and it was such a great opportunity
 'cause, you know, I really, it was the first time
 I met other kids from New York that were my age
 who were acting, and it sort of, I met my manager there
 who I've been with for 20 and somewhat years,
 and that was like my first headshot.
 And I think they have that on the wall over there.
 The Stage Door Manor summer camp hall of fame.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Just really, really thinking about that Gossip Girl role
 in that picture there.
 Do you remember any of the productions that you did
 while you were there?
 I did, yeah, I did Grease.
 I did Grease, Sweet Charity, and On the 20th Century,
 so they were all musicals, yeah.
 Wow, and that's why they hung you in the rafters there.
 Yeah, yeah. You had to retire
 the jersey. Yeah.
 All right, Sebastian, how you doing?
 You ready to move on here to the second half?
 Yeah, I think so, Queen Majesty.
 Okay, Tiger.
 Moving on to the number six sauce.
 Tiger, Tiger, burning bright.
 Probably gonna have a salad tonight.
 (laughs)
 Okay, interesting.
 Still hanging on there.
 You're doing great. Yeah.
 You're doing great.
 So I found your podcast appearance
 alongside screenwriter Jacob Kruger
 to be a really interesting peek
 into your reverence for writers' rooms
 and your perspective as an entertainer in general.
 Why, in your opinion, should every actor
 take a screenwriting class and vice versa?
 Wow, I'm so impressed you know about Jacob Kruger.
 He needs to watch the show.
 You're always, as an actor, trying to figure out
 how to best use your time when you're not working.
 You know, I've always dabbled with writing,
 and this was a great course,
 and it sort of set a pretty standard,
 pretty simple way into it.
 And then I do feel like it teaches you
 how to be a better actor as a result,
 'cause you're just sitting there
 kind of breaking down script analysis over and over again.
 You're trying to figure out how,
 when you're writing something,
 you're actually going through the thoughts
 that would lead to what that line is
 or that dialogue or whatever.
 So I feel like it helps you,
 and you start to know what scenes really matter
 or what you really need or what you're trying to say.
 So it definitely helps.
 Be careful.
 Oh, God!
 Yeah, I got you.
 Oh, you're right.
 (laughs)
 You're right.
 I got you.
 "13 Angry Scorpions"?
 Jekyll and Hyde.
 The color, too, is--
 Menacing.
 Yeah.
 Oh, this one's bad.
 You can tell right away.
 Oh, yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Holy shit.
 It's got almost like a tangy, sort of sweet barbecue
 kind of vibe to it,
 and then very disruptive with the sort of violent
 pepper action that happens underneath it all.
 Quite a way to describe it.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, it's like...
 It's kind of like an accident happening
 in my mouth right now.
 Yeah.
 Well, let's take you back to happier times.
 Do you have a most treasured memory
 from the time that you spent a year studying abroad
 at Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London?
 You know so much.
 It's amazing.
 You know what?
 Mark Rylance, watching Mark Rylance,
 he was in Richard II,
 and he was really good.
 I wanted to cry today, so this'll be good.
 (laughs)
 And anyway, he was so fantastic
 that I still can't get over it.
 How important or unimportant do you think
 formal acting training is for an aspiring actor?
 Listen.
 It's very important to study and train
 and work on your craft.
 Vitamin D, very important as well.
 I have to take a sip of this.
 It's all right.
 I'm glad that you're the one who broke the seal, you know?
 I did it.
 I did it.
 Oh.
 First time I had whole milk in about 20 years.
 Anyway.
 It's, yeah, it's super important.
 I think, you know, theater especially.
 Are you ready to move on to the next one?
 This is "Da Bomb Beyond Insanity."
 Well, all I know is that there's a word on it
 that's a caution.
 (laughs)
 (laughs)
 (laughs)
 (dramatic music)
 (gags)
 Back to the...
 (groans)
 Yeah.
 I love the...
 I love milk.
 So my dad, who's literally never texted me
 about someone I'm interviewing ever,
 he wanted me to tell you that he thinks
 "Captain America Winter Soldier"
 is the best Marvel movie of all time, and I quote,
 "It advances character arcs, not just plot,
 and it functions in part as a political thriller
 with terrific fight scenes.
 It's a kick-ass superhero movie."
 What would you say discerns a kick-ass superhero movie
 from a generic one?
 I love your father.
 (laughs)
 I think you need good character, development, plot,
 and...
 Milk.
 Yeah, you definitely need milk.
 Plot, character, and milk.
 And good action sequences to break up the pain.
 Have you given any more thought to the travel show,
 the destination travel food show
 that you'd wanna do with your MCU co-star, Anthony Mackie?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 What would be the first location you'd go to
 to shoot the pilot?
 Hmm.
 We would go...
 I really wanna go to Japan.
 That'd be awesome.
 Personally.
 But I don't know if I'll make it there.
 Anytime soon.
 And has he been on the show?
 He has, he has been on the show, actually.
 He probably got through these pretty well.
 He did, he did.
 Of course he did.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, I always thought he and I should do a traveling show.
 Maybe we will.
 And you know what?
 If you need a home for it.
 This is where we start.
 This is where we start.
 Right.
 You're doing great, Sebastian.
 I know you're going through it, but you're doing great.
 Are you ready to move on to the next wing?
 Pucker Butt Pepper Company's...
 Hmm.
 Mean Green.
 Okay, well.
 Yeah, well.
 So much for...
 So much for...
 Eating tonight.
 Oh, wow.
 I don't know if you saw Jimmy Kimmel, but...
 Sure kept those steel balls.
 (laughs)
 You left them on his desk.
 I did.
 Could have brought some of yours.
 Times like these.
 (laughs)
 But anyway.
 What other fun facts do you have over on that table?
 Well, you know what?
 I was intrigued that when your acting career took off,
 you avoided that sort of entertainer reflexive impulse
 to move to Hollywood,
 saying a very, very, very, very, very, very,
 you know, the dream of New York
 that you find it more grounding,
 while LA is not a good compass.
 I did say that.
 Well, I guess it's to each his own, right?
 But I grew up in cities all my life.
 And so I just, I thrive off that impulsive experience.
 You know, kind of being able to
 sort of live in the moment
 and not, you know,
 plan everything.
 Can you speak to the special personal significance
 of the West Side Highway to you?
 Oh, I do love the West Side Highway.
 God, what?
 Do I talk about all these things publicly?
 Why?
 I do love the West Side Highway.
 I, you know, I've just, I go running there and
 I've been in there in tears.
 I've been in it, you know,
 I felt like through a lot of different times in my life,
 you know, it's like,
 for some reason, I don't know.
 It's just like my happy place.
 Your backbone, your foundation,
 the West Side Highway, it's always been there for you.
 Oh yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 All right.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 What a ride.
 What a ride it's been.
 Oh God.
 (dramatic music)
 Viva la vida loca.
 Living that life and look at us,
 taking on the wings of death,
 making it here to the end.
 And just one more question before we put you out of here
 in a wheelbarrow full of crushed ice.
 We've talked at length about your movies,
 but before we go,
 I think it's important to acknowledge your love
 of astronomy and you even interviewed astronaut Scott Kelly
 from the International Space Station
 while it was in low orbit.
 I did.
 To close things out,
 what is the recent discovery, UFO sighting,
 or space fun fact that fascinates Sebastian Stan the most?
 Oh, I've always been very fascinated by
 the idea that we could colonize Mars.
 You know, I think I read somewhere that
 if you got a bunch of satellites
 the size of football stadiums,
 and you put them around Mars,
 you can melt the ice and then there would be water
 and then we could live there, maybe.
 And so when I was a kid,
 I was like really obsessed with Mars
 and I would just always read up on Mars.
 And that's just one thing that comes to my mind.
 But in case you haven't seen Don't Look Up, you should.
 Mark Rylance bringing it full circle here.
 Yeah, we're all gonna die.
 (laughing)
 But here we are.
 Fun fact.
 Sebastian Stan making it through the Hot Ones gauntlet,
 taking out a glass of milk,
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you, Sebastian Stan.
 This camera, this camera, or this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 After this lunch, not a whole lot.
 But this is very fun.
 And anyway, tune in to see Fresh on March 4th,
 or Pam and Tommy as it's currently playing.
 And thank you for having me and knowing so much about me.
 (laughing)
 Knowing more about me behind it.
 (applauding)
 You're the best.
 Dude, it's so funny.
 I mean, this is like,
 it's like you don't think that it's really gonna impact
 anything, but it does.
 (laughing)
 You're like really high, you know?
 It's so great.
 Thank you guys for having me.
