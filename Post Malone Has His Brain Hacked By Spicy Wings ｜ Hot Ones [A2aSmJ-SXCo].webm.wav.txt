 Am I in frame?
 We'll find you.
 [laughter]
 [music]
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Post Malone.
 He's an artist we sat down with some five and a half years ago,
 and in the time since, he's just gone on to smash billboard and streaming records.
 He's one of the highest selling, most decorated musicians of the last decade.
 He also has a brand new, long-awaited album on the way, 12K Toothache,
 which is coming soon and I for one can't wait.
 Post Malone, welcome back to the show.
 Sir, thanks for having me.
 Before we get started, I'm curious, have you been experimenting with hot sauce at all since we saw you last?
 Do fans ever bring up your OG Hot Ones interview in the wild?
 It's like one of the top five biggest episodes we've ever done.
 Sure, hell yeah.
 Did you guys send me a Habanero one?
 We probably did.
 And I think you signed it, but I wanted to taste it so bad, so I cracked it.
 I was just like, yeah, I gotta eat this.
 And then I drank it straight.
 But it looks like the lineup has changed a little bit here on season 18.
 It is.
 It's actually a brand new lineup.
 And here's kind of a fun fact that this is the very first time that I'm taking on this lineup.
 And it's right along with you, Post Malone.
 I wouldn't have it any other way.
 Sir, let's get it on!
 [Music]
 Classic garlic Fresno.
 I see we've gone tendy this time.
 For you, Posty.
 I love you. I love you guys.
 All right, diving in.
 [Music]
 This is delicious.
 The spice, I'm impervious.
 No problem.
 [Laughter]
 It's got a little after-burn, but other than that, it's nice.
 So as we mentioned up top, you have your fourth studio album on the way.
 And I think it's worth mentioning that your first three are something like a combined 18x platinum with beer bongs and Bentleys and Hollywood's Bleeding, each being number one records, respectively.
 You had a recent interview with Billboard where you said, "I don't need a number one.
 That doesn't matter to me no more."
 And at a point, it did.
 I didn't know that you said 18 times.
 That's pretty fucking awesome.
 That's a lot.
 That's so cool.
 Thank you, Sean.
 There was a moment to where I lost my passion to make music.
 You know, it's like it becomes a job.
 I was just a kid, you know, and making music and I had all these songs and everything, but it became a job, you know, with labels and touring and everything.
 And it gets so hard to actually focus on why you're there.
 You know what I mean?
 It used to be like, okay, we get in the studio and be like, let's make hits.
 Let's bring a bunch of producers and let's bring a bunch of different artists in.
 But on this record, there's only a couple producers, a couple artists, and I just want to make shit.
 Finally, now that I'm back, it feels like I was in a cocoon and now I'm a beautiful butterfly.
 We're seeing the metamorphosis happen right before our eyes.
 I'm here, and now I'm here.
 You know what I mean?
 But yeah, I'm so excited.
 I'm so excited.
 This is the best, the best piece of work that we've ever done.
 Is mezcal like tequila?
 Does this have booze in it?
 Yeah.
 We're getting messed up.
 We're getting messed up.
 Sean, that's good.
 Hitting two for two so far.
 That's good.
 There we go.
 Do I get to take some of these home?
 You get to actually take all of them home.
 What?
 Yeah.
 That's good, Sean.
 Oh my god.
 And you know what?
 If you want me to sign another one for you, I will.
 Yeah, sign them all.
 There we go.
 I got you.
 I got you.
 Yes, sir.
 So between Stone Cold riding ATVs around Broken Skull and John Mayer ditching West Hollywood
 from Montana, I'm fascinated by guests who've taken on a more secluded lifestyle.
 Sure.
 Have you had any close encounters with wildlife since moving to the Seven Acre compound in
 the backcountry mountains of Utah?
 Oh, man.
 Um, there is a big mama cougar that runs around.
 And so we have dogs and stuff and a cat.
 And we built, like, it's like a big gate fence.
 It's supposed to keep all the wildlife out, but somehow this big cougar keeps getting in.
 She's crafty.
 Very crafty.
 Also, there was an alien there.
 What?
 Not like a physical alien, but like a ball.
 I think it was an alien.
 Or ghost.
 We caught it on the infrared camera.
 Does alien count as wildlife?
 It's very wildlife.
 Yeah, I guess.
 Extreme wildlife, I think.
 I don't know.
 Demons count as wildlife or aliens, but, you know, I don't know.
 It was so cool.
 We saw it.
 So we got cameras all around the whole place.
 And just this big orb, I'd say like, like if you take Sauron's eye, so it starts forming
 the shape of like Sauron's eye and goes under this door.
 And I don't know what that was either.
 I don't know if that counts.
 Yeah, well, between that and the cougar, it sounds like you got your hands full.
 Well, yeah, I don't know.
 I'm scared.
 It's like fucking Dark Souls whenever I go outside.
 It's like Elden Ring whenever I go outside.
 I don't know what the hell I'm going to find out there.
 You guys know, nothing fazes me.
 This one is the Adobo Loco.
 Okay.
 Island wing sauce.
 It does get hotter.
 Yeah, that's how the show is formatted.
 That's how it goes.
 That is how it goes.
 Yeah.
 Coming through.
 Yeah, I tell you what, my shits are going to be crazy.
 Can you give me a beat that the first time you heard it, you knew that it would be a
 post Malone Stadium anthem.
 And then can you give me another one that maybe you didn't fully understand or vibe
 with at first that turned out to be a massive hit for you?
 I feel like I knew.
 I knew Congratulations was going to be big, but that's just because the genius Quavo
 was in the room.
 I was like, "Yo Quavo, what do you think about this?"
 He's like, "This shit is crazy."
 And Metro too.
 I don't know, maybe Psycho.
 I didn't think it was going to be as big as it was or Candy Pain even because I made
 that too.
 I was like, "Okay, I like this song."
 Because I've always been a fan of major chords and happy music, but talking your shit at
 the same time.
 I think that's a perfect balance and it's very tongue-in-cheek and it's very...
 I love that.
 I think it's probably Psycho.
 I didn't know that people would like it that much.
 I was like, "Okay, yeah.
 Fuck yeah.
 Okay, thank you so much."
 It's not that bad.
 There we go.
 Yeah, I think it actually is not quite as spicy as 3.
 I felt like 3 played some psychological games with us.
 I agree.
 This one's in my head.
 This is delicious, but it's not as hot.
 Exactly.
 So I'm always fascinated by what goes into making an athlete's signature shoe.
 In the world of a musician, what are the conversations like when you're tricking out a custom guitar
 or deciding which instruments you're going to bring with you on tour?
 I went to...
 There's a place called Carter's in Nashville.
 They had this 1938 Martin and it was owned by a guy.
 I think his name was like Hobo Bill or something, like something crazy.
 It had his songs in the guitar case and a rattlesnake tail inside of it.
 I got two guitars that are my favorite guitars.
 Sunburst Les Paul that I played on the Nirvana thing.
 I'm the shittiest guitar player and it makes me feel like I'm the best in the world.
 And Willie Nelson's guitar is so cool.
 It's got a big hole in it.
 It looks like he punched it.
 I don't know.
 I'm more of a road worn...
 I like the road worn look.
 Yeah, you like the story, the backstory.
 Yeah, it's definitely been through some shit.
 And this guitar's been through some shit.
 This dude killed a rattlesnake and threw this tail in there.
 I was like, this is crazy.
 I love that.
 Are you ready to move on here to the halfway point?
 Okay.
 This is the Sauce Leopard Seventh Reaper.
 And there is some Carolina Reaper in this one.
 Some tomato, some garlic, some Reaper.
 That smells like death.
 Okay.
 It tastes delicious, but it's hot.
 It's definitely billowing.
 It's definitely puffing it up inside.
 It's stoking the flame.
 Yeah.
 Hey, that's pretty good.
 So far.
 Are we five for five?
 Yeah, we're five for five.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 Yep.
 All right, posties, you may recall we have a recurring segment on our show called Explain That Gram
 where we do a deep dive on our guests' Instagram.
 We pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull the picture up over here on the monitor.
 You just tell us the bigger story.
 Okay.
 That guy's cool.
 Seems like it could use some further explanation.
 Sure.
 And then I'm also curious, you know, as somebody who's been a video game junkie your whole life turned musician,
 how important is music to the gaming experience for you?
 Have you played Elden Ring?
 No, no, but I've got to get on that.
 Yeah, you should play that.
 There has been times in that game I turn the music all the way off because it is insane.
 It's like literally like choirs, like not of angels, of demons.
 And you're like, we're going to fuck you up.
 There's no way you live.
 And after a fight I have to like, I'm like shaking like this.
 So I have to walk outside and smoke.
 And I'm like, I need to decompress and like do all this shit.
 But music is very important, however, to video games.
 Whenever Skyrim came out, the theme song gave me chills as a kid.
 And there's so much, some of the best music comes from video games.
 There's like such epic songs like Zelda has a crazy soundtrack.
 Elder Scrolls has a crazy soundtrack.
 All this like Mario.
 Sonic.
 Yeah, there's no one in the world that doesn't know the Mario song.
 It's so cool.
 It's like the Star Wars.
 It's like Star Wars songs and the Lord of the Rings songs.
 It's just they're timeless pieces that super nostalgic on, you know, watching it.
 You know, it's super cool.
 This, I needed to get my kill death ratio up.
 So I said, what's going to give me the edge?
 I said, put some damn night vision goggles on and see what's going on.
 No, yeah, if I turned those on right there in that picture, I would probably go blind.
 You ever seen Step Brothers where they're like, yeah, that's what happened.
 We got a one more 40.
 But that was a fun night.
 And I took it.
 It was just for the picture.
 I played one game.
 Just one.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Ghost pepper really shines through in that one.
 Oh my God.
 Hot and saucy.
 Hot and saucy.
 Like you Sean.
 I'll take it.
 I'll take what I can get at this point.
 Now you say it back to me.
 Hot and saucy.
 Thank you Sean.
 All day.
 All day.
 Thank you, sir.
 Totally original compliment.
 And I didn't tell you to say it.
 Special for you.
 I didn't tell you to say it.
 It's perfect.
 And I meant it.
 I meant every word.
 Honestly, it's an amazing game.
 It's a great game.
 Honestly, it's an assault on your tongue.
 It's gone now.
 Yeah, we're back.
 We're back.
 It's gone now.
 We're over it.
 It came and went.
 We've turned the page on it.
 Turned the page.
 It's delicious.
 It's absolutely delicious.
 Six for six?
 Six for six, Sean Evans.
 There we go.
 There we go.
 So I've heard you talk about resisting pressure to say jam-pack an album with 20 or 25 tracks.
 Very much so.
 In what ways do you think the economics of the music industry influences the way that music is put out these days?
 I guess right now, I suppose the algorithm is set up for...
 What the hell was that noise?
 That sounded like Predator from AVP or something.
 The format right now, I guess it's the more songs you have, the more you're going to stream.
 It's kind of like, it's almost like an accuracy by volume.
 Because you could throw 20 songs or you could throw 20 blobs of goop at the wall.
 One of them is going to stick.
 Maybe more than one is going to stick.
 But I think what's interesting about this album is it's 42 minutes, 14 songs.
 It's a story and I think more so than anything I've made before.
 It's a living, breathing entity almost.
 I'm so excited.
 I'm so pumped.
 I love that.
 Alright, Posey, you're ready to move on.
 Seventh Sauce.
 You're doing great so far.
 Okay.
 This one is the "Halo-Gee."
 "Tear Fingers Curse."
 It's a sleeper.
 Yeah.
 I don't feel it.
 There we go.
 I don't feel it.
 Let's go.
 It's not that bad.
 It is delicious.
 Seven for seven then I'd have to say.
 Seven for seven.
 There we go.
 First test drive on the new lineup could not be going better.
 I'm passing it to you.
 I'm passing it back.
 We look like mages dueling.
 Can you Photoshop?
 I'm not Photoshop.
 Do it.
 Colin, eat it.
 Colin will go in.
 Go nuts.
 Also make me eight feet tall, please.
 Alright.
 We'll take a swing at that.
 There we go.
 Tall post.
 So when we had Dave Grohl on the show, he talked about how he pulled a muscle in his hand,
 playing "Message in a Bottle" by The Police, and you're a distinguished cover man yourself.
 What do you learn from performing the music of other greats like Bob Dylan or Darius Rucker
 or Nirvana?
 Everything that I want to do musically,
 Jesus.
 It's there.
 It's still reminding me.
 It's reminding me.
 I think it heard you talking.
 Yeah, exactly.
 That's the whole thing.
 You talk shit.
 It's like, "That's not hot."
 But it'll be like, "I am hot."
 These are people that I've looked up to for so long,
 and being able to hear that, "You didn't fuck it up."
 It feels really good.
 Sting is nuts.
 Yeah.
 He's a nut.
 The shit he does is insane.
 He's epic.
 I watched the show, I don't remember,
 "The Only Murders in the Building" was Sting in there, and I thought that was great too.
 That's so random.
 What's wrong with me?
 This sauce is hacking my brain, man.
 It's in the main frame.
 It's Da Bomb.
 It's Da Bomb.
 RIP to us.
 Oh my God.
 Instant.
 Not hot.
 Not hot.
 Wow!
 Wow!
 Not easy for me either.
 That's such a jump!
 Yeah.
 What's the tingle like?
 Oh my God.
 It's not hot.
 Yeah, no, it's not hot.
 It's easy.
 Sup, dude?
 No problem.
 No problem.
 No problem.
 You having a problem?
 I'm having no problem.
 No, sir.
 I know.
 I know.
 Not hot.
 I just wanted to say it's hot.
 Not hot.
 What?
 9.5 Alpha Black Lotus printed in 1993.
 Signed by Chris Rush.
 It's just the holy grail of Magic the Gathering,
 which is the best game ever created.
 That's what you get, Sean.
 There you go.
 It's hard to find.
 What would you say is the biggest misconception
 about Magic the Gathering and the people who play it?
 You know, it might be conceived as, like, nerdy.
 I'm a fucking nerd, and I'm so damn happy to be a nerd.
 I don't spend...
 I used to, but I don't...
 do bowel service anymore.
 I don't go to strip club.
 I just sit in my room and play with cards all day.
 But it's not bad.
 It's pretty normal.
 Sauce. Type of sauce.
 Cheers, Sean Harris.
 Cheers.
 Cheers at home.
 If you own this hot sauce, take some with us.
 Take some with us.
 That's a big bite.
 Mistake. Mistake.
 Alert.
 You know what?
 It can't be worse than the last one, though.
 It can't be worse than the last one.
 This one, like a really spicy curry or something.
 Tastes like sausage.
 This one, yeah.
 Tastes like a bratwurst.
 Yeah.
 So I know that you long have been obsessed
 with the metaphysical,
 and then you even appeared on that ghost adventure show
 where you explored a meat packing...
 where you explored a meat packing plant in Arizona.
 A haunted meat packing plant in Arizona.
 Can you give me like a ghost hunting starter pack?
 Like if I were to go hit the streets,
 like what's some equipment that I need?
 Am I in frame?
 We'll find you.
 Sean.
 I'm telling you. I'm telling you.
 Is it worse than you remembered?
 You got a tough gig.
 Yeah.
 It's very worse than I remember.
 Guys, do I have any boogies?
 You're all good. You're clean. You're clean.
 There's...
 You need an EMF detector.
 It measures like...
 And all of this stuff, Sean Evans, is just a legend.
 Yeah, right?
 Take the notes.
 It's just...
 I can't...
 I'm not a scientist.
 I like Bigfoot shit.
 Like I like...
 You know what? It's fun.
 Like whatever. Who knows?
 But sometimes it's just fun to go on that ride.
 There's something going on.
 Yeah.
 There's definitely something going on that we don't know about.
 But EMF detector,
 a voice recorder,
 preferably analog.
 Okay. I'll put the analog.
 A camera with infrared
 or night shot.
 And then you're good to go, Sean Evans.
 We can go wherever the hell you want.
 Yeah. All right.
 We can go wherever we want.
 Next time. Next time.
 Next time.
 We'll go to your buddy's house.
 Let's go.
 Okay. We'll go to Texas.
 We'll do this in Texas,
 and there will definitely be demons there.
 In the toilet.
 All right, Posty.
 After the episode.
 Okay.
 You're the boss, Sean Evans.
 I'll do whatever you tell me.
 When
 has the last time
 you've heard someone say FML?
 Fuck my life?
 Probably 2015 or something.
 Do you remember that?
 But now it's just absent.
 There's no one says FML anymore.
 We've got to bring it back,
 and now it's kind of a good time.
 FML.
 FML.
 FML.
 FML.
 FML.
 FML.
 You hit the dab at the same time you say FML.
 That's perfect.
 How much did you put on?
 I'd give it a nice little smattering over here.
 Okay, so you smatter it.
 I smattered it.
 Sean Evans, please.
 No.
 It's actually not hot.
 Let's go.
 It's actually not hot.
 All right.
 Post Malone,
 you have now conquered the wings of death
 for a second time.
 And to close things out,
 we really want to put the two of us to the test
 with a little quick last dab beer pong.
 We're going to put one cup on your side.
 Thank you.
 One cup on my side over here.
 I am going to--
 I don't know if you remember these.
 These--
 You remember these?
 Yeah, I remember those.
 Just a quick little sudden death beer pong game.
 Okay.
 You go ahead and go first.
 No, you go first.
 All right.
 Those glasses are mad cool, too.
 You remember these?
 Yes, sir.
 Those aren't the same ones.
 Not the same.
 Not the same.
 It's not bad.
 No, you got to dance.
 Fuck my life.
 Fuck my life.
 Fuck my life.
 Fuck my life.
 Fuck my life.
 I'm ending it right here.
 That's cool.
 That's cool, really.
 Last dab standoff.
 FML.
 FML.
 Everybody all around.
 Post Malone.
 Sean Evans.
 Taking on the wings of death.
 Conquering.
 Winning in beer pong.
 Did you drink it all?
 Yeah.
 You're such a legend.
 Let's go.
 Post Malone, there's nothing left to do but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, or this camera, let the people know what you have going on
 in your life.
 I have an album coming out soon.
 It's called 12K2.
 It's got 14 very amazing songs on it.
 I'm the happiest I've ever been.
 Thank you for waiting for me.
 Just be as good as you can and don't be a dickhead.
 I love you very much.
 This is Sean Evans, a POT1's fan.
 The best to ever fucking do it right here.
 Finding his cameras.
 Yeah, they're everywhere.
 But let's party.
 [Applause]
 I'm so happy.
 Dude, I'm so happy to be back.
 I'm so happy to be here.
 Like, this is the best show ever.
 You are the best host.
 You are genuinely the best host because you are such a beautiful person, man.
 Like, it's mind blowing how great you are.
 Give me a hug, buddy.
 I love you.
 I love you too.
 You're the best.
 Wow!
