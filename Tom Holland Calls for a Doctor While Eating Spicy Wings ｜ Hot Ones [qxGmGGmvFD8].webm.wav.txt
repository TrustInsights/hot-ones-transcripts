 Oh, mate, that is...
 (sniffling)
 That's the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we close out season 16 with Tom Holland.
 He began his career at 12 years old
 in the West End production of "Billy Elliot."
 Now he's one of Hollywood's biggest box office draws,
 from award-winning performances
 in "The Impossible" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 And on the topic of the latter,
 he stars in what's sure to be
 one of the year's biggest films, "Spider-Man, No Way Home,"
 which is set to release in theaters on December 17th.
 Tom Holland, welcome to the show.
 - Hello, mate, thank you.
 Thank you for having me.
 - And before we begin, one last time for season 16,
 how are you with spicy food?
 What's going through your head as we prepare to dig in?
 - I'm okay with spicy food.
 I mean, at Nando's, I'm a medium,
 or a hot if I'm feeling adventurous.
 Extra hot is too far gone for me.
 So I think today is gonna be rather brutal,
 and I think everyone will get to see a side to me
 that no one has ever seen before.
 Maybe I haven't even seen this side to me
 that's about to come out.
 But I'm very excited, I'm a huge fan of the show.
 It was actually my mate, Twain, a couple years ago,
 was like, "You should do this show called Hot Ones."
 I was like, "What's Hot Ones?"
 He's like, "It's a show where you eat spicy chicken wings
 and you talk about stuff."
 I was like, "That sounds so stupid."
 And then I watched the first episode,
 I watched Idris Elba,
 immediately was obsessed with your show,
 and have since then been a huge fan.
 (dramatic music)
 - The classic hot sauce, okay?
 - Oh yeah, other side, other side, other side.
 - You just saved me.
 - Dom.
 - If I went for the worst one, the first wing.
 - Dom.
 - Can you imagine?
 - Can I say a huge thank you?
 (laughing)
 Because that would have been,
 we would have cut this well short.
 Okay, so we're going over here.
 - Yep.
 - All right.
 Oh yeah, that's nice.
 Wow, I am getting a bit of a kick now though.
 - So Spider-Man No Way Home
 features the return of Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus,
 a role that he had more than 15 years ago,
 which I imagine is a unique situation for an actor.
 Can you recall an instance of his mind being blown
 by the technology and innovation
 that goes into making Spider-Man movies today?
 - I've got a delayed reaction,
 the old classic hot sauce there.
 Obviously when he was making the film,
 I think it was 2002 maybe,
 his arms, his sort of robotic arms were puppets.
 They were like real tangible things
 and they'd have a guy on each one
 and they would puppeteer them while he was performing.
 So he had to work in tandem with the other four guys.
 On this film, obviously technology has advanced,
 CGI has become so prevalent in these films.
 So it was amazing seeing him have a bit more freedom on set
 with the way he could move
 without having to rely on other people.
 We had this thing called a toothpick rig,
 which is like a long bar,
 like almost like a crane with a platform on one end
 and weights on the other.
 And they put him on that crane
 so they can move him around
 so that it looks like the arms are carrying him.
 And he loved it.
 Like he absolutely loved it.
 But the funny thing is, is that you'd be talking to him
 and he'd be attached to the rig
 and because he has no control over where he goes,
 he'd be talking to you and he'd be like,
 "Yeah, so Tom, I'm from South London."
 And then he would just suddenly like disappear
 and he'd be like, "Oh, fucking hell, mate.
 I'll see you later."
 So it was a plevage, sorry, the spices.
 Do you know what it is?
 I've got still chicken in my teeth.
 - Right.
 - It comes, I know that all too well.
 There's lots of times where I'm putting up a front,
 like it's not bothering me, but every episode,
 every episode I have it.
 - But it was a privilege to get to work with Alfred.
 He was a good guy.
 I really liked working with him.
 It's very sweet.
 That was really nice.
 I actually really liked that one.
 It was quite sweet.
 I didn't really get any vinegar, but it was nice.
 I liked it.
 The next one looks nasty though.
 It's very red.
 Chicken's not supposed to be red like that.
 Okay.
 - So I was interested to read that "Spider-Man"
 "No Way Home" director, John Watts,
 actually assigned a John Hughes movie marathon,
 which you hosted at your Atlanta home.
 - Yes.
 - And I'm curious if you think there's any common DNA
 between the "Spider-Man" franchise that you star in
 and then these classic coming of age teen movies
 from the 1980s.
 - There definitely is.
 John definitely took inspiration from those movies.
 There are aspects of the way characters are dressed
 or the way they look.
 That is definitely inspired by those movies.
 And I think that is what sets our franchise apart
 from the rest of the kind of superhero genre
 is that they have this kind of really happy-go-lucky
 teenage coming of age high school movie vibe,
 which I've never really seen before.
 In a superhero film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off for me
 was the one that had the most inspiration for "Spider-Man."
 This kid who's kind of breaking the rules,
 but he kind of is doing it for the right reasons.
 But the biggest inspiration for me
 and my biggest goal in playing "Spider-Man"
 was I really wanted to be this generation's Marty McFly.
 - Yeah, I love that.
 - That's up for everyone else's opinion.
 But for me, I'm really proud of what we did
 and especially my relationship between me and Downey.
 To me, there's a lot of similarities
 between Marty and Doc.
 And I know that they have deep faked us
 and made that happen,
 which actually was a huge honor for me.
 I loved seeing it.
 But yeah, so that for me
 would have been the biggest inspiration.
 I'm feeling good.
 I'm feeling good.
 - You look good.
 - Thank you, mate.
 Yeah, it's nice.
 - Kind of like a barbecue sauce
 with like a little kick to it.
 - Yeah, that's good.
 I like that one.
 - So your career, it's taken you around the world
 and I've read that you like to visit golf courses
 in each new city that you visit.
 I played baseball my whole life
 and I think the muscle memory of swinging a bat
 has ruined any potential I'll ever have
 of being good at golf.
 Do you have any general swing tips
 for just hopeless duffers like myself?
 - Short on your backswing is what I'd say.
 'Cause the golf clubs now, the technology is so advanced
 that you don't have to hit it that hard
 for the ball to go that far a distance.
 So shorten your backswing and don't try and hit it too hard.
 - Well, I'm taking notes.
 They're down.
 I'll climb to the course next time I go.
 Are you ready to move on here to the next wing?
 Los calientes verde and you're doing great.
 - Los calientes verde.
 Okay.
 This one looks like it's gonna surprise me.
 It's got a bit of a green hue in there.
 - It is.
 It's got a green hue.
 - Oh, it's immediately spicy, this one.
 Fucking.
 I'm gonna go for a second hit though.
 - But you're going back in.
 - 'Cause it's really nice.
 Salute.
 Okay.
 Wow.
 Wow.
 This is such a good idea for an interview.
 Because my brain,
 my brain is all over the place.
 You could ask me anything.
 - We've got 'em.
 - And I would be so honest.
 So you had an interesting line on the Nerdist podcast
 where you talked about how playing a superhero
 kind of takes away your biggest super power as an actor
 since you're also covering your face.
 What do you see as the limitations
 or maybe even the opportunities for an actor
 when you do spend half a movie hidden behind a costume?
 - I mean, it comes with its own set of challenges,
 for sure.
 Fuck me.
 Wow.
 I wanna try and do this and not have any milk.
 - Okay, we'll see how that goes.
 - But I don't think that's gonna--
 - Yeah, there's no shame in that.
 - We're not even, we're only four in.
 It's definitely difficult.
 I mean, as an actor,
 you use expression with your face to convey emotion.
 And when you take that away,
 you have to figure out how to do it with your physicality.
 So if you took off the Spider-Man suit
 and I behaved the way I would while in the suit,
 you'd think I was a crazy person
 and acting way, way too much and too big,
 but cover up your face,
 all of a sudden those bigger reactions feel normal.
 My secret weapon is that I will always pretend
 like my arms are dead,
 so that when I move, my arms kind of swing around.
 And so Peter Parker's hands are always doing
 the most crazy stuff.
 And for me, that has been a really good way
 of like making him feel youthful
 while also in moments of peril and stuff like that.
 But it's also sometimes a great thing.
 Like if I've gone out the night before
 and had a little bit too much to drink,
 if I've got a mask on, no one knows, so it's fine.
 (upbeat music)
 - I'm supposed to be going to a Lakers game tonight.
 I'm gonna have to go and shit after every quarter.
 (laughing)
 Let's do this.
 Revolutionary.
 - This one's a little...
 - Yeah.
 - One's good.
 - That is revolutionary.
 - Yeah.
 - Fucking hell.
 - As advertised.
 Wow.
 Wow.
 All right, Tom, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram.
 Interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll show you the picture over here on the monitor.
 - Oh, Johnny B.
 - A fellow season 16 Hot Ones alum right there.
 - Right.
 I love him so much.
 He's one of the greatest guys I've ever met.
 I remember doing a scene with him.
 I told this story yesterday, actually.
 And I said to him, sometimes as an actor,
 if you're doing a scene that requires like real stress,
 I find it quite helpful if someone kind of
 roughs me up a little bit.
 And I said to John, I was like,
 "Mate, listen, before the scene,
 could you just rough me up a bit?
 And, you know, just scare me a little bit, please."
 And he was like, "Nah, man, I don't want to do that.
 Like, you're my little brother.
 I love you, man.
 I don't want to do that."
 - Good impression.
 - I was like, "Okay, I appreciate that.
 If you don't want to do that, that's fine."
 And they went, "Right, rolling."
 And they went, "Action."
 And he went, "Whack."
 (laughing)
 And I was like, "Oh my God."
 And it was great.
 And it worked so well for the scene.
 But he just didn't want me to know it was coming. But he properly cracked me one.
 I look back on that as a very fond experience,
 and meeting him was, you know, one of the highlights.
 We haven't had the chance to work together since,
 but I would love to.
 Oh my God.
 It just came back.
 - Yeah.
 They can sometimes, when you least expect it.
 - But like, from deep within.
 This looks really nice.
 I can't wait to try it.
 (laughing)
 Okay, I'm just going to eat it.
 Ready?
 - Ready.
 - Oh no.
 Oh no.
 Oh, it's not that bad.
 - At first.
 - At first.
 Oh, it comes.
 Oh yeah, yeah.
 - Starts to grow on you a little bit.
 - It's so interesting, isn't it?
 How it hits you like, "Wow."
 (laughing)
 That's amazing.
 (soft music)
 Sometimes, I really try to figure out
 how to make my voice sound cooler.
 If I'm doing scenes, I just need to eat fucking spicy.
 - We figured out a technique here today.
 - Wow.
 Okay.
 I'm going to go for a second hit, because I want to--
 - Okay, then I'm going back into it.
 - See how that, okay.
 - I feel like I'm really seeing the actor side of you.
 You know, like really immersing yourself in the experience.
 - I really want to see what this is about.
 Well, that's way worse the second time.
 Wow.
 Well.
 It's in my nose now.
 - So I know that while you're weary of overly laddish
 behavior, that the pub culture, the old school pub culture,
 it still has a special place in your heart.
 And then pub food, to me, it's an endless topic
 of fascination whenever we visit London.
 - Can you explain what a carvery is for the uninitiated?
 - Oh, a carvery.
 A carvery is, firstly, amazing.
 It is a portion of food that normally revolves around
 a piece of meat.
 It can be any meat.
 I don't know if this is an actual rule,
 but I know that my local pub used to do it
 when we were kids.
 But if you're 16, so two years under the legal drinking age,
 if you have a carvery, they are allowed to serve you
 a pint of beer.
 I guess the idea is that the amount of food
 cancels out the beer.
 Obviously, as kids, we would abuse that rule
 and go and not eat the food and just drink a beer.
 But a carvery is like a portion of meat with food,
 like a roast dinner.
 - What does it mean if a dish is minging?
 - Minging means it's disgusting.
 Like that last wing was minging.
 - Well, if you thought that was minging,
 we'll see what you think about the next one.
 - The milk looks so good.
 Wow.
 Oh yeah.
 That's not that bad.
 Wow.
 That one's not bad.
 I like that one.
 - Yeah, it's tasty.
 - It's the second hit.
 - It's the, yeah, I think it's when you go back in.
 - Listen, I didn't come here to play.
 I can come here to eat these chicken wings.
 - So there's a lot of lore surrounding
 that 10 minute long tsunami scene
 that opens up the impossible, your feature film debut.
 - Yeah.
 - Is it true that you guys only had one shot of doing that
 because to rebuild the set and shoot it again
 would have blown the budget?
 - Yes.
 Oh my gosh.
 Essentially what they did is they built...
 They built like a, oh man, my lips are...
 They built a set that was a third of the size
 of the actual hotel in which it happened.
 They had something like 3 million liters of water
 in a huge tank with these breakaway doors.
 And essentially the director had this big red button.
 I think they were using something like 14 cameras
 at the same time, all set in specific locations.
 There was obviously no one on set while this was happening
 'cause it was very dangerous.
 Oh my God.
 Then they hit the button and the water came out
 and destroyed the set.
 And it was incredibly impressive to witness.
 It looks great in the film.
 And then obviously what they do is they upscale it.
 So the third size model then looks full size.
 And then they put us in, they comp us in.
 And it was amazing.
 It was really incredible.
 And that's the end of my story.
 And fuck me, that is so spicy.
 - Is it true that you blew a Star Wars audition
 'cause you couldn't contain your laughter
 reading lines opposite someone pretending to be a droid?
 - Yeah, yeah, that's very true.
 I don't think that's the reason why I didn't get the role.
 I think John Boyega was just better for the role than me.
 But I just remember thinking,
 there's no way this lady's gonna read the robots lines
 opposite me just because that would be ridiculous.
 And I don't remember what my line was,
 but it was, "Let's get back to the Falcon."
 And then this lady, bless her, would sit there
 with full commitment and she just was like,
 (imitates robot beeping)
 And I just remember thinking, the first time she did it,
 I went, "Oh, that's funny. Oh, wow.
 All right, brilliant. We'll do it again.
 We'll do it again. Sorry."
 Did the line again.
 (imitates robot beeping)
 I remember sort of saying,
 "You're not actually gonna do that, right?"
 And she was like, "Well, yeah,
 the robot's part of the scene. He's the character.
 It's R2-D2 or C3P. I don't know."
 Yeah, I just got the giggles because,
 you know when you realize you've got something so wrong?
 - Yeah.
 - I just couldn't stop laughing.
 I'm not gonna try the lemon
 'cause I wanna do the whole experience.
 And then at the end, when we cut the cameras,
 I'm gonna drink that milk so quickly.
 - We're gonna bring in a whole other gallon for you.
 - I'm gonna drink it so quickly.
 You have no idea.
 Let's do it. The de bombe.
 All right, ready?
 - Yep. - Let's do it.
 Oh, I've gone for the bone.
 Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
 Oh, no, I didn't even put it in my mouth and-
 - Whoa.
 Victoria just went like this.
 - Oh, no.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Oh, mate.
 Oh, mate.
 That is so bad.
 - Uh-huh. You and me, same page there.
 - Oh, fucking hell.
 Do you finger lick or do you, at this stage-
 - No, I'm not. - Are you just?
 - I just survive.
 - Oh, my God, that is so bad.
 - At this stage, I just survive.
 - Oh, my God, Sean.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 (sighs)
 - I think it's time to try this lemon drink.
 If this is a joke and this is gonna make it worse-
 - We're not setting you up, not setting you up.
 I don't know if it'll help that much.
 - That doesn't help.
 - I don't think anything will.
 I don't think anything will.
 - Oh, man.
 I'm gonna have to walk this off for a second.
 - Yeah, yeah. Take a lap, take a lap.
 We've seen some laps on this show.
 (sighs)
 - Huh?
 - Do you want a Magnum?
 - Yeah, I would love a Magnum.
 You don't have any Magnum?
 Oh, mate, that is...
 That's the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.
 Wow, I feel so sick.
 - You okay?
 - I'm fantastic, man.
 I'm having the time of my life.
 (laughs)
 I feel like I just got like Botoxed,
 but had no anesthesia or something.
 Not that I've ever had Botox, I don't know what it feels like.
 That's where the whole world's like, "He's had Botox."
 (laughs)
 Can I please have some more milk?
 - Yeah, we're on it, we're on it, we're on it.
 Coming through. - Thank you so much.
 I can give you a hug.
 Oh, I see you.
 - We got a secret.
 Dom is always here with the milk.
 - I appreciate it.
 - So, tell me, Paul Ruggs episode.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Our favorite episode.
 - Let's sit down and talk about it.
 - I'm sure you know why.
 - Yeah.
 - Look at us.
 - Look at us.
 - Look at us.
 - Who would have thought?
 - Who would have thought, mate?
 Fuck me.
 This one is up to 12,
 meaning that you should be 12 and above or 12.
 - I think on a scale from one to 10.
 (laughs)
 Oh, mate, I'm so stupid.
 If it was for underage,
 it would have said,
 not advice for people under the age of 12.
 Okay.
 Oh, wow, I feel cold
 and on fire at the same time.
 Like my insides feel like they're burning,
 but my outsides feel like it's really cold.
 Oh, I don't want to do this.
 All right, we ready?
 - I'm ready.
 - Let's go.
 I've got a lot of that on my lip there.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - I'm a second dip there,
 'cause I don't think I got it.
 - Are you sure?
 - Yeah, I'm a second dip, 'cause that.
 - Are you sure?
 - Yeah, we're going.
 - All right. - We ready?
 - Oh, yeah, that's spicy, man.
 Oh, wow.
 Oh, yeah, wow.
 Okay.
 So I'm always amused when I hear you say
 that people confuse you.
 From one of those British actors with classic training,
 remarking that you went only to 2% of drama school classes.
 What do you think an actor learns
 just going directly into the industry,
 talking to directors, being on set,
 that maybe they wouldn't pick up
 if they went to a prestigious drama school like RADA?
 - I think that sometimes
 a benefit of not going to drama school
 is going in fresh
 and allowing your teachers to be the director, you know?
 And this is a piece of advice I got from Robert Downey,
 actually, to let my body do the work
 rather than thinking about everything.
 So for me, I tend to learn my lines the morning of,
 so that the moment I'm saying them,
 they're as fresh as possible.
 And is that doctor here?
 - It's fucking wow.
 I'm not joking.
 - No, I'm joking.
 - Okay, well.
 (laughing)
 He's a good actor.
 He's a good actor.
 - This might be the best milk I've ever had.
 - Like an oasis, like you've been walking through the desert.
 - That's exactly what it feels like.
 Right, the last one on the list.
 Apollo.
 (dramatic music)
 The last dab with the Apollo pepper.
 Okay, all right, let's do this last dab.
 - But I have to say, you know, whoa!
 - That's too much, is it?
 Listen, I've committed now.
 It's there.
 That looks like...
 Maybe hit that with a little...
 - No, I've done it.
 I've made my bed, I'm gonna lay in it.
 (laughing)
 I feel like I'm about to jump off a cliff or something.
 That's a lot as well.
 I put way too, you put a tiny bit on there.
 You've shown your experience.
 - I know, but you know what?
 I gotta join the party.
 This is the season 16.
 - Yours, wow.
 - This is the season 16 finale.
 The season 16 finale, and Tom, you've been so brave
 coming into this, not sure how it was gonna go,
 and look at you, drenching sauces,
 going in for double hits.
 - All right, let's do this.
 - All right, cheers, Tom.
 - It's been a pleasure, mate, I've really enjoyed this.
 - Pleasure is all mine.
 - Oh, look how much I got.
 - I know.
 (screaming)
 - I hate my job.
 - Oh, mate.
 I know, but Tom, the good thing is,
 you've slayed the spicy sauce beast.
 We have put the nail in the coffin of season 16,
 and if we've learned anything through this interview,
 it's that you love movies, and that you love making movies,
 and I've heard that you have a propensity
 to maybe take a souvenir or two from set,
 and so to close things out, I just wanna ask you,
 of all of those souvenirs that you've taken
 from movie sets over the years,
 what is your holy grail,
 the one that has the most sentimental value to you?
 - The most, oh, wow.
 I'm going in.
 - Whoa.
 - Next time I do a crying scene,
 I'm calling you, and you gotta send me this hot sauce.
 - I will show up on set, I will show up on set.
 (upbeat music)
 My favourite souvenir was actually given to me.
 It wasn't given to me,
 it was given to my little brother Paddy.
 When Black Panther was coming out,
 Robert Downey Jr. was making book to do little in London,
 and he was staying down the road from where I live,
 and he invited us to a screening of Black Panther
 at his house.
 And Paddy comes running into the room,
 and he's holding the original Iron Man helmet,
 and Downey had given it to him as a gift.
 That's a really special one for me,
 because I was lucky enough to join the MCU,
 but I joined it very late,
 and that souvenir, you know, that's from the original film,
 that's the birthplace of this incredible world
 that Kevin Feige and Marvel have created,
 you know, and Downey and Favreau kickstarted.
 So to have something from that film is a huge honour.
 - A holy grail, and look at you, Tom Holland,
 putting a bow on season 16,
 taking on the wings of death, and living to tell the tale,
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you, Tom Holland.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - It's part of my No Way Home is coming out,
 December 17th.
 It's the best part of my movie that's ever been made.
 It's so fun and exciting.
 It's emotional.
 It's heartfelt.
 It's such an honour for me to have played Spider-Man
 for all this time, and for it to come to this point.
 Honestly, he means the world to me.
 I'm gonna be sick, so I'm gonna sign off.
 It's been a pleasure, thank you so much.
 (audience applauds)
 Please feel free to roll on this.
 It's the bomb.
 Well, God, Jack, you took a big old bite there, mate.
 - Are you good with spicy food?
 - Don't mind him.
 That's hot, though.
 - You're the coolest person I've ever met.
 Jack's just gone, that's hot, though.
 - You know what, though?
 We're using a film in Canada.
 Oh my God.
 - Yeah, that's getting hot.
 (audience laughs)
 - And the director had this hot sauce.
 Yeah, you just have the glass, I'll have the jug.
 - You're getting on, mate.
 - You are there, bro.
 How you feeling?
 Water makes it worse, as well.
 - You know what, we need that milk, mate.
 Where's the milk gone?
 - That's awful.
 - Oh, I think I'm gonna shit my pants.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, Hot Ones fans?
 This is Sean Evans, and there are many reasons
 to be a monthly Hot Ones subscription box subscriber,
 but if you ask me, at the top of that list
 is the fact that you get to try things first,
 before anybody, and that's what's happening in December,
 because in the December subscription box,
 for the first time ever, hot sauce for kids.
 That's right, hot sauce for kids.
 I'd like to introduce you to Hot Ones Junior,
 the green.
 This sauce is a super tasty flavor clash
 of green apple, sweet banana, warm jalapeno,
 lets kids sort of experience the Hot Ones tradition,
 but at the foothills of Mount Scoville,
 it's perfect for french fries, chicken nuggets,
 the things that kids love.
 Get your hands on Hot Ones Junior,
 be the first to try it in the December subscription box,
 heatness.com, heatness.com to get your hands
 on the green, Hot Ones Junior, before anyone else.
 It's super tasty, and it's a hot sauce for kids.
 (upbeat music)
 (silence)
