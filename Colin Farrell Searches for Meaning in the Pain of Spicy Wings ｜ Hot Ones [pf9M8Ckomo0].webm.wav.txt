 (grunting)
 - For a younger generation--
 - It's that bit under the tongue, man.
 - I know, it is that bit.
 - Ugh.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans,
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings,
 and today we're joined by Colin Farrell.
 He's a Golden Globe Award-winning actor
 with a number of eagerly awaited projects on the way,
 including his role as the Penguin in "The Batman"
 coming to theaters on March 4th,
 a role he'll then reprise in an HBO Max series
 that delves into the Penguin's rise to power,
 so be on the lookout for that.
 And he also stars in the "Cogonauta"-directed
 science fiction drama "After Yang,"
 which is likewise set to release on March 4th.
 Colin Farrell, welcome to the show.
 - Thanks for having me, Sean.
 I am already in trouble a little bit.
 I'm trying to figure out which ones.
 I did a little tap on it on a thing,
 and I didn't know they were--
 (laughing)
 - Already spiced.
 - I'm already, now, do we only do a dab at the end?
 - Yeah, only a dab at the end.
 - Should we get that out of the way?
 - I like how you have some insight here.
 - Yeah, 'cause my son was very excited, my youngest boy,
 Henry, was very excited about me coming on,
 so we watched a couple episodes.
 I've actually never had so many people excited
 about me doing a show, ever.
 Seriously, when I say so many, I mean three.
 But I have a very tight group of not many friends.
 Yeah, my brother-in-law and one of my best friends, Mark,
 and his son, Charlie, and my boy, Henry,
 were so excited about me coming on here,
 and I never had anyone in my life saying,
 "Oh my God, you're going on Jay Leno?"
 or any of those, so here we are.
 - Well, are you ready to put on a show?
 - Come on, man, I know I can't fail.
 How does one fail?
 (dramatic music)
 All right, bon appetit.
 - Bon appetit.
 - It's also breakfast, so it's a bit weird.
 (laughing)
 Just before the heat starts, it's just a bit nasty already.
 - So your new film, "After Yang," is a sci-fi film
 that bucks many of the genre's conventions,
 from its focus on the natural world,
 instead of a futuristic metropolis,
 and then even the technology,
 which is really more of a background character.
 "Kogenada" has such a distinctive filmmaking style
 and aesthetic.
 Thinking back to your time on set,
 what would you say makes him distinct as a director?
 - I was told never to speak with my mouth full,
 but that would be bad television.
 So we'll continue to talk.
 He is a really beautiful man, Kogenada, honest to God.
 He's the loveliest, kindest, most gentle man.
 Did you see the film, yes?
 - I did, I saw the film.
 - Some of it, so there's a kind of a peacefulness
 and a meditative aspect to the film.
 And Kogenada feels like that as a man.
 He's incredibly zen and has a mad depth to him.
 Again, it's not loud, there's no action,
 there's no massive emotional outburst in the film.
 It's all very calm and very,
 but the questions that it asks,
 the areas in which it's curious
 in relation to the human condition,
 for me were fascinating when I read it.
 I just loved it.
 But it wasn't a page-turner, which sounds bad.
 It's like, "Oh, it wasn't a page-turner,
 "so you weren't that interested."
 No, I really was, but it was a slow read.
 'Cause as I was reading it, I was very affected by it,
 more than I am most of the time in reading scripts, you know?
 So, and his aesthetic, Kogenada,
 I think it was his great grandfather,
 was an incredibly renowned artist in calligraphy,
 which made perfect sense when he told me that,
 'cause it kind of, like, of course,
 he's your understanding of space
 and your understanding of geometry and architecture
 and, you know, all made sense.
 So I had such a joy to work with him.
 What's this one, Dawson's?
 Is the spice only on the top,
 or do I have to eat the whole thing?
 I know that I don't have to do anything, I get it,
 but you know what I mean.
 I'm in for a penny and for a pound.
 Right, well, there is full coverage on the wing,
 so there's no way that you can duck it.
 Oh, that's important.
 What I did earlier on did me a favor.
 I messed myself up by having a dip of a later one,
 so the first one I didn't even notice.
 Wow, you're--
 It's just a lot of meat, obviously.
 Trailblazing a hot one strategy over here.
 Yeah, accidentally.
 Some of the best things I've done in my life have been accidents.
 No intention on my part.
 So I'm interested in that fundamental part
 of being an actor, which is deciding
 what projects you're interested in
 based on what's on the page.
 What is the actual process of reading scripts like for you?
 Like, how is it different, if at all,
 from reading for pleasure?
 That's a nice question.
 Sometimes a script can be really good
 and you can feel really strongly about it,
 and it could be really,
 I did a thing called "The North Water" on television,
 and it was so-- Love that show, by the way.
 Oh, thanks, man.
 It was so dark and it was so heavy,
 and it was so grotesque, and it really was concerned
 with the darker recesses of the human experience
 and the human mind and the ugliness that we're capable of,
 which is visible everywhere we go, of course,
 but this was condensed into five hours
 of really heightened drama.
 And reading it was a task, but it was still brilliant.
 It was still really enjoyable.
 I was still gripped by it.
 And sometimes you read scripts and you don't connect
 and you, in any way, but sometimes you need money
 and you go and do them anyway.
 That's happened a couple of times, you know?
 And even then, I'm very grateful to be--
 Like, the majority of people in the world,
 I would imagine, or a lot of people,
 don't have a job that they feel connected to.
 So even if, you know, when you hear that thing
 where people say, you know, in Hollywood,
 if they do a money job,
 and then one that they're more passionate about,
 they go, "One for them and one for me."
 It's like, really?
 You got five million doing one for them?
 So generous.
 One for them, one for me.
 It's all for me, but sometimes I get spoiled
 where I really feel connected to the material.
 It means a lot to me.
 I get to bring my uncertainty as a parent
 and my uncertainty as a partner in the past.
 I'm single now.
 My uncertainty as a friend, as a human being,
 I get to bring that to work a little bit.
 Not as therapy, per se,
 but it does come onto the dance floor
 and I get to ask certain questions
 that I've already been asking myself just as a man, you know?
 Calabrio.
 Calabrian chilies.
 All the way from Italy?
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, fuck.
 Have you built up a tolerance?
 Have you built up a tolerance over the years?
 You have.
 Or just a familiarity with the pain
 that allows you to experience it
 in a way that doesn't totally freak you out?
 The way that you said that,
 the familiarity with the pain,
 I think is the most important thing
 because I know what to expect.
 It's like life.
 Yeah, exactly.
 The older I get, it just is this familiarity
 with the pain of being human.
 So a lot of times, though, the guests, though,
 it'll be the spiciest thing
 that they've ever eaten in their lives
 and then they're doing it in this bizarre context.
 You know what I mean?
 So sometimes I just try to be like a support system
 and not focus on my own pain, if that makes sense.
 Nice, yeah, yeah.
 I respect that, man.
 So I understand that despite being roughly the size of Maine,
 Ireland has many different accents and dialects.
 So much so, in fact, that you probably notice the difference
 just driving 10 miles from village to village.
 Yeah.
 Of all the dialects that you've had to master
 for various movie roles over the years,
 which was the most tedious or most time consuming to learn?
 Honest to God, I tried a couple of times to do,
 I don't know what you call it, standard American.
 When someone says standard American accent,
 and I find that the trickiest,
 'cause generalities don't really help you as an actor.
 Do you know what I mean?
 The more specific you can be, of course.
 You can focus it.
 Yeah, and then within the specificity
 that you've found yourself aligned with,
 then there's room for play.
 Of course, you'd always be free to do this, that,
 and the other, it's not about,
 but if just a general American accent,
 it just sounds general, it sounds vague,
 and it almost sounds insulting.
 It sounds like you're not respecting the character
 or the project or the script,
 that you really should get very specific.
 So all the really good dialect coaches,
 they're as sociologically interested as they are in sounds.
 They really give you a whole context
 for the world in which this character grew up
 and how they feel about certain things
 and the political or economic climate
 of the area they grew up in.
 So that's when it gets really interesting,
 and that's when it gets really specific,
 but generalized American, I would be like,
 "Oh, I just feel vanilla," but that's me.
 I can't blame general Americans, whatever they are.
 Angry Goat Phoenix, like a hybrid.
 Oh, it's got a little tang to it, doesn't it?
 - Yeah.
 - It's the first one that went off the reservation
 and decided to bring in a little fruit.
 (laughing)
 Broad, goes across the mouth, doesn't just hit one spot.
 - Full coverage, just like the wing here.
 - Yeah, indeed, absolutely, ambient.
 - So when we had Tom Holland on the show,
 he talked about how playing a superhero
 can sometimes take away your biggest strength as an actor
 since your face is always hidden behind a mask,
 but that it allows for more physicality in the performance,
 and I'm wondering if a corollary can be made for prosthetics
 or even a Mike Marino-designed fat suit.
 Like, how does playing the penguin in a costume
 in which you look unrecognizable,
 how does that shape or inform a performance?
 - For me, it was absolute liberation.
 Look, being covered, I thought.
 - Oh, careful with your eyes.
 - Oh yeah, ooh, amateur mistake.
 Oh man, thank God I wasn't eating with my knuckles.
 (laughing)
 I thought that it would be very limiting.
 I really did, I thought I'd be very just oppressed
 by having this whole thing, and it was totally the opposite.
 When the piece moves as well as the piece
 that was designed for the penguin moved,
 my eyebrows moved and my cheeks and my smile,
 it was fucking insane.
 I didn't have any fear that Colin could be seen through.
 Like, some days you wake up as an actor
 and you're having a shit day, man.
 You know, you've had, like people do,
 you've had bad dreams, something's not going right
 in your personal life, and you go into work
 and you have to pretend to be someone else,
 and that could sound like a relief.
 Oh, well, you're having a shit time as yourself,
 so cool, you get a few hours to be someone else.
 Not really, you can't not bring yourself to the party.
 You're always there.
 So there was something about, there was a buffer
 between me and my fellow actors with this mask on
 that just liberated me like I'd never been liberated before.
 So it was the complete opposite of what I thought.
 It was so much fun, so much fun.
 And it was three or four hours,
 it was four hours to start in the chair,
 and then they got it down to about two hours,
 but it was worth every minute.
 Los Calientes, bro.
 Is it true that the climactic concert scene in Crazy Heart,
 that you guys only had 10 minutes to shoot that
 because it happened in the middle of a Toby Keith concert?
 Yeah, man, I thought I was gonna get bottled.
 I thought I was a fucking dead man,
 'cause I think, I don't know,
 I'd had a few films anyway that didn't work,
 and I'd played a couple of characters
 whose sexuality was in question.
 And you know, anyway, just look, Toby Keith concert,
 and there were a bunch of us crowd having a good time,
 and they were well in the evening,
 and the beers had been, were on board.
 And I know if I was at a, if I was a fan of Toby Keith,
 and I was at a Toby Keith concert,
 and I was half cut, and then somebody come on and said,
 "We're gonna just stop the evening now,
 "'cause a bunch of actors wanna come on
 "and do a little make-believe."
 And I'd be like, "Fuck you!"
 So I really kind of wanted a shield out there in front of me,
 but everyone was cool.
 That was just my fears.
 Everyone was awesome.
 And they had a crane at the back of the stadium,
 and then they had a Steadicam coming on the stage
 to get the closer stuff, and it was well orchestrated.
 They'd been there all afternoon.
 So we just went on and, as you do, bluffed.
 Yeah, it was cool. It was fun.
 Is it true that while filming "The Recruit,"
 Al Pacino actually damaged the car
 that you guys were driving around in,
 and then the damage is actually visible in the film
 when you guys roll up to the Saigon Pagoda?
 I love, I have no idea, but I will research that later on.
 Driver's side, back door, big white streak.
 Did he? Big white streak.
 I remember something about that, man.
 I was, you know, yeah, I might remember all of that project,
 but I'll research it, probably.
 Sounds echoes of familiar.
 Is it true that Steven Spielberg
 hired the 12 best contortionists in the world
 to do that futuristic yoga scene in "Minority Report"?
 Oh yeah, I heard that, yeah.
 The 12 best contortionists in the world.
 Imagine being number 13.
 (laughing)
 That would fucking suck, wouldn't it?
 Yeah, well they said it was unlucky for some, I guess.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 I know there was a bunch of people
 that were able to do mad things with their bodies that day,
 but I wasn't working.
 Is it true that the open heart surgery scenes
 and the killing of a sacred deer are very real
 and that you actually attended
 a quadruple bypass in person?
 Real, real, real, real, real, real.
 It doesn't get any more real.
 Smelling, burning flesh.
 Yeah, it was intense.
 Very intense.
 I fucking never saw anything like it in my life, Sean.
 So upsetting.
 As horrible as it looked,
 I had an appreciation for the checks and balances
 of the human body.
 I did, I came away from it going,
 "Okay, it really is what we've all known,
 "but I've seen it in action when it's been broken down
 "and somebody's trying to fix it."
 It is put up, it's in a garage,
 and it's a car, it's an engine, it's a computer,
 it's whatever.
 There are certain things that have certain consequences
 and you plug certain things in certain somewhere,
 obviously it's gross simplification.
 But I came away from it going,
 "Yeah, but it was weird, I wouldn't want to see it again."
 Wow. Yeah.
 On that note.
 On that note, are you ready to move on to the next wing?
 Yeah.
 All right, so this one, Queen Majesty, Coco Ghost.
 Coco Ghost.
 I'm expecting, obviously, a little hint of chocolate,
 at least, or I will be very disappointed
 in writing a letter to Queen Majesty,
 which my people have sure done many times over the years.
 That's not her, is it?
 They try to make all the labels really more threatening.
 Yeah, as you go down.
 Yeah, like those energy drinks that look like
 they're hucking plutonium in a fucking can.
 You know, those ones.
 Crushing it.
 Crushing it.
 So, on working on The New World
 with legendary director, Terrence Malek,
 you told this amazing anecdote
 about how an actor was delivering their lines
 and Terrence would hear a bird off camera
 and then pan over to the bird
 while the actor was mid-dialogue.
 Can you expand on what you meant
 by the beautiful contradiction
 of his obsessive planning and freeform sensibility?
 I remember one time there was a rainstorm
 and we were shooting in West Virginia.
 Sheet lightning coming down and then forks,
 loud, loud, claps of thunder deafening.
 And then I heard one of the views go,
 "Oh Jesus, oh Christ, will somebody go and get Terry?"
 And we looked out and it's fucking dude,
 Terry Malek has a conductor.
 He has a camera, which is a fucking conductor, basically.
 On his shoulder and he's out in the,
 and the grass is blowing
 and he's in the middle of a fucking lightning storm.
 It was the most beautiful thing ever.
 And he's not stupid, Terry.
 He's very bright, very wise man.
 But he just is so enamored with
 and so fascinated by nature.
 Which is why sometimes human beings
 aren't really the central aspect in his film.
 Extraordinary fellow, but he did.
 I mean, and every actor that's worked with him,
 if they've worked close with him,
 have a story of them being mid-sentence,
 you know, thinking they're fucking breaking new grounds
 in authenticity.
 And I never forget it.
 I never forget it.
 I was, I was,
 Koryanka was there and I was,
 I had a couple of lines I had to say.
 And as I was saying, I'll never forget it.
 Oh, is that an offspray?
 And awfully fucking,
 and I found myself somewhere between insulted
 and so enamored with his honesty
 and his sense of presence, you know?
 Gorgeous man.
 13 angry scorpions, that makes sense.
 Even the color of it.
 Oh yeah, already.
 Has kind of a sweetness up front.
 Already.
 There's a threat in that sweetness though.
 Well, I was to tell me about,
 there was a ghost pepper that time with chili Klaus.
 Chili Klaus?
 Yeah.
 Was it the ghost pepper you had?
 We ate a Carolina Reaper together.
 Is that the hottest?
 It was the Guinness Book of World Records
 hottest pepper in the world.
 And just ate that pod straight up.
 So what was that like?
 What was that ghost pepper like?
 It was like giving yourself food poisoning.
 Yeah, really look bad.
 Like 12 hours.
 Yeah.
 Like the cramps, just the cold sweats, you know?
 You go from like being overly, overly hot.
 Your body's just going,
 I don't know what the fuck up down.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Exactly.
 So.
 Regulate, regulate.
 You go there, you go.
 It doesn't know what to do.
 Your whole equilibrium is scrambled.
 Like I would,
 the only way I'd ever do that again
 is if Chili Klaus, who I cannot say no to,
 approached me and was just like,
 we gotta do it, we gotta do a part three.
 That's the only reason I'd do it.
 Was it the once you did it together?
 We actually did it twice.
 We did it on two different occasions.
 Brutal.
 Yeah.
 And you were sick for a few hours afterwards?
 Was that nice?
 Yeah, five or six hours.
 And just like holding a jug of milk in my living room
 and just filling my mouth up with the milk
 and just keeping it in my mouth and just spitting.
 I'm feeling that fucking,
 you must've wiped your ass in years, man.
 You must be like the king of the dab.
 Exactly.
 Just clean, clean.
 Oh my God, just dab.
 Just a little dab will do you.
 That's brutal.
 Yeah, it looked like it was very painful.
 He just loves it, doesn't he?
 He just finds meaning in that pain.
 Yeah.
 (claps)
 (laughs)
 It's...
 So lovely.
 Such a lovely way about him.
 All right.
 Let's do it.
 It is that time.
 It's a bomb.
 Beyond insanity, Sean.
 Why would we go beyond insanity on a Tuesday morning
 or 11.48 or afternoon at 12.53 or whatever it is?
 I know.
 Okay.
 For entertainment, that's comedy.
 That's what it is, yeah.
 That's comedy.
 Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 All right, let's see what this has got.
 Yeah, that's fucking tons of...
 It has a lot to say.
 Yeah.
 Doesn't it?
 It's chatty.
 It's chatty.
 This one never gets any easier.
 (laughs)
 It really is...
 As advertised?
 No, but it's good to see you suffer.
 You know the way they say misery loves company?
 It really, it does help.
 Well, I'm happy I could be that support system for you.
 Do you know what's the most insulting one
 is under the tongue?
 You know that bit of the guitar string under your tongue?
 Yeah, I know that one.
 That bit when that fucking hurts like it is now.
 Bollocks, I didn't think it'd get me that much.
 (coughs)
 Fuck, this is gonna last a while.
 Oh, fuck.
 Oh yeah, 'cause you can't wipe your tears.
 Yeah.
 One second.
 The name of your autobiography.
 Can't wipe the tears.
 I'm stealing that from...
 Don't steal it, I give it to you.
 Woo.
 I like--
 Fuck.
 Inhales.
 (coughs)
 Thank you, that's good, I'm good.
 What's that?
 Something to help?
 You're crying.
 You gotta be--
 (burps)
 Oh, fuck, man.
 All right.
 Are you sure?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Woo.
 Yeah, I'm good.
 Thank you.
 For a younger generation--
 It's that bit under the tongue, man.
 I know, it is that bit.
 (groans)
 For a younger generation that might fuck
 at the idea of watching a black and white movie
 from before their time,
 what makes the 1959 classic Some Like It Hot?
 I love it so much.
 A timeless film that you never get sick of rewatching.
 I was gonna say Marilyn Monroe,
 and that's true in some sense.
 But, fuck this.
 Got me.
 The comedy is ageless.
 The film is just a beautiful word to inhabit.
 And Marilyn Monroe, look, for me,
 was the first time I fell in love, you know?
 The first time I experienced romantic love,
 I think I was seven or eight.
 (laughs)
 And already I wanted to rescue Marilyn.
 I could make her happy.
 I was looking at Lollipop.
 I could make her happy.
 But, yeah, I just...
 It's a perfect film.
 It's a perfect film.
 It's just a perfect romp.
 It's perfectly entertaining.
 Some of the comedy in it is, I mean,
 Jack Lemmon thinking that he's gonna marry the guy.
 (hums)
 You know what I'm saying?
 I see it at least once a year.
 Beginning to come back to fucking Planet Earth.
 Me too, me too.
 Wow, that was really intense.
 I know.
 It was like a blackout almost.
 Same, and now I have like kind of a lightheadedness
 going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, aura.
 I can see your aura.
 It's otherworldly.
 But with that in mind.
 God damn.
 Okay, yeah, sure, man.
 This one, this next one, is the pucker butt.
 (laughs)
 Mean green.
 The pucker butt.
 Okay.
 Oh, and it.
 (dramatic music)
 The pucker butt.
 Extreme heat, but I think after the last one,
 it's almost a walk in the park.
 Oh yeah, the last one just, it's a bomb.
 It just carpet bombs your whole being.
 Worst thing that one does, the last pucker butt
 is just activates the fucking.
 It reactivates.
 The cumulative effect of the hot one's gauntlet over here.
 All right, yeah, what are we doing?
 This is great though, so ridiculous.
 So ridiculous.
 You having a good time?
 Yeah, it's fantastic.
 It's so stupid.
 Not, you know what I mean.
 No, I take no offense.
 Yeah, no offense.
 I understand 100%.
 I do for a living anyways.
 So when Daniel Day Lewis won the award for best actor
 for his performance in "My Left Foot",
 he said in his acceptance speech.
 Amazing.
 That the voters had given him the makings
 of one hell of a night out in Dublin.
 Yeah.
 Is there a film of yours that you think is most likely
 to earn you a free meal from a stranger at an Irish pub?
 At an Irish pub.
 At an Irish pub in Los Angeles, it would be "SWAT".
 Yeah, yeah, it's a funny one.
 But in Dublin, maybe in Bruges,
 that seems to be, people seem to like that one.
 That'd be a lot of what I'd hear at home
 if I ever heard anything good from home.
 I'm joking.
 But my people have always been lovely with me.
 I think in Bruges is the one I'd hear most through the years.
 All right, Colin Farrell.
 Sean.
 Sean, what's your surname?
 Evans.
 Sean Evans.
 Yeah.
 So where are you from?
 Gaelic, actually.
 Where's your family from?
 Ireland, but I've never traced it all the way back.
 You're dying to go to the country.
 How many generations?
 I'm gonna hit you up for the recs.
 Please do, yeah, give me a number
 and there's a couple of places I'd love you to go and see.
 I enjoy so much through the years
 when people have said to me,
 I'm going to Ireland or we're going to Ireland,
 is there a couple of places you can recommend?
 And just writing a few things on a,
 sending a text, it just, I get to go back for a second.
 It's lovely, I enjoy that, so I enjoy that very much.
 Yeah, you love it.
 And what a profound thing it must be
 to have Irish heritage and go back there
 and retrace your roots.
 Exactly.
 This summer, I'm trying, I'm trying.
 Oh, there's the last, the last dab.
 Oh, so this is you guys, is this, ah, Jesus.
 There it is, you have your own,
 of course you do, you'd be a fool not to.
 And we call it the last dab
 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing.
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 Okay, the last dab, the last dab.
 If you ever open a pub, you know what to call that as well.
 What do I call it?
 The last dab.
 The last dab?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Is that it?
 That's it, you did it.
 Okay, man.
 Cheers, Colin.
 Cheers, brother, it's been a pleasure.
 All right, Colin Farrell, at long last,
 we've conquered the wings of death
 and just one more hurdle
 as we bring this thing full circle.
 I've read that the seeds of your acting career,
 planted when you saw Henry Thomas's performance
 in "ET, The Extra-Terrestrial",
 a performance that moved you to tears
 and inspired you to pursue a career in acting.
 Can you describe in as much detail as possible
 under these very bizarre circumstances,
 what is it that you find on the whole remarkable
 about "ET, The Extra-Terrestrial"?
 What I thought was remarkable first when I saw it
 was ET, you know, and the excitement of that
 and the creature coming from a distant plane
 and I would still find that remarkable about it.
 But what I find more remarkable now is
 what a story it is about a broken family.
 You know, like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind",
 I mean, Spielberg has made some of the most,
 as far as I'm concerned,
 entertaining films in the history of cinema.
 But even when they're really entertaining,
 at their core, there is some kind of emotional
 or psychological fracture going on
 and the family in "ET" is in trouble
 and the feds walking through the forest
 and it's always the keys rattling.
 Those keys haunted me.
 Anytime I heard keys rattling as a kid,
 I was haunted.
 And magic.
 And when they take off for the first time
 to that forest and they start flying,
 I got goosebumps, I got teary-eyed
 on the couch this Christmas.
 But that's me, my mortality and stuff,
 I'm sure of it.
 Fucking, you know, nostalgia and all that melancholy.
 Yeah, but so many reasons why it's a great film.
 A beautiful and eloquent love letter
 to "ET, The Extra-Terrestrial"
 and look at you, Colin Farrell,
 taking on the wings of death very impressively.
 Gauntlet down for the count.
 Now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 What I have going on in my life?
 Oh God, where do we start?
 Career or personal?
 (laughing)
 I don't have anything going on.
 I'm an actor, I'm look gamefully employed
 and there's a couple of things coming out
 in a few weeks, one called "The Batman"
 and then another called,
 and "The Batman" you'll probably hear about
 and see loads of trailers and posters and stuff,
 but the one that really needs a bit of help
 is called "After Yang"
 and it's a small independent film
 with a lot of heart, I think.
 Anyway, that's what I got going on.
 And then nothing else, I'm unemployed now,
 so if anyone out there has any scripts
 or actors, come around.
 God bless y'all.
 (clapping)
 Thanks, man.
 - That's such a thrill and--
 - It was a pleasure, man.
 - My favorite part of my job is diving in the material
 and watching so many movies--
 - God, you fucking asked great questions.
 - Oh, thank you, I appreciate that.
 - Fucking great, honestly,
 they're the best questions I can recall being asked,
 I think ever, 'cause I was trying to think of Charlie Rose,
 but he didn't really give a fuck who I was.
 - But we do have the same set.
 - Charlie Rose, Charlie Rose is talking about,
 I saw him at Martin McDonough,
 and Charlie Rose looked at me or something
 and he went, you did this film, "Miami,"
 I think he said "Miami Whatever" or "Miami Something,"
 he didn't even fucking, he couldn't even get,
 he couldn't even get the second word of a two-word title
 of an '80s show that was really iconic.
 This one's for Chilly Claus.
