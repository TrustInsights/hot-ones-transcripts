 (dramatic music)
 (laughing)
 - Hey, yeah!
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Tessa Thompson.
 She's an actress whose resume runs the gamut
 from critically acclaimed Indies
 to box office shattering blockbusters,
 including Westworld, Creed, Thor, and many others.
 And on the topic you can catch her in her role as Valkyrie
 in the latest Marvel release, Thor, Love and Thunder,
 coming to theaters July 8th.
 Tessa Thompson, welcome to the show.
 - Hey, thanks so much for having me.
 This is so cool.
 - What's going through your head
 as we prepare to dig in here?
 - I'm just wondering if I made the right choices
 this morning.
 Like I didn't eat, that seemed like a good thing to do,
 but then also should I have lined my stomach?
 You know, I'm just, I'm thinking around if I'm prepared.
 - Well, there's no looking back now.
 Are you ready to get started?
 - Yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 Really nice.
 I might like a little more.
 - Have at it.
 - I got a smell.
 What's happening here?
 Mm, okay, peppery note.
 Yeah, it's a garlic hit.
 A lot to play with in there.
 A lot to play with.
 - Yeah, balanced on the tongue.
 - There we go.
 - I didn't eat, so.
 - Now we're lining the stomach, you know?
 So the thing that makes the Thor franchise
 my favorite in the MCU is it's particularly
 a reverent and comedic tone,
 especially when you compare it to other superhero movies.
 What would you say makes Taika Waititi's
 approach as a director unique in the genre?
 I've heard you gush about his childlike sensibilities.
 - I think that's a big part of it.
 Also, when we made Ragnarok,
 the whole idea was to basically destroy
 every Thor movie that had come before,
 not in terms of success,
 just to like bash all of the tropes,
 the tone, and make something that's entirely different.
 This next installment has been interesting
 'cause it's trying to sort of recapture the magic,
 but I think it's being able to hold
 a lot of different tonal pockets all at once.
 Can a film be funny and silly and irreverent,
 but also can it be heartfelt?
 Can it be earnest?
 And can those things careen into each other
 in a way that feels organic?
 But I sort of think that that's the way that life is.
 So it makes sense.
 Plus we play a lot of music.
 I think that helps.
 Mm, mellow.
 - That's how we start you off.
 Lull you into a false sense of security.
 - Terrifying.
 But it's jumping on the tongue.
 - Yeah, a little dancing right here.
 - Yeah, like tap dancing, like without tap shoes on.
 You know what I mean?
 Like it's just a light little flutter of flavor.
 - A light rain on a tin roof.
 - Exactly.
 - There we go.
 - One you can hardly hear.
 You're like, is that?
 Oh yeah, that's it.
 - So I often hear actors liken the Marvel films
 to Greek mythology or Shakespeare.
 Is there anything that you learned while performing
 at the Los Angeles Women's Shakespeare Company
 that helped inform your approach to Valkyrie?
 - Oh, that's so interesting.
 Yeah, something we talked about,
 'cause you know, we're always gender swapping.
 So many of the women in that company would play men.
 And there was this idea that men just are more
 kind of upright, that men aren't inclined
 to like break their lines.
 And for some reason that we associate that with power.
 So if I'm here talking to you in a scene
 and I'm doing a lot of this or this,
 it's a way of signaling.
 It shouldn't be, but a way of signaling
 that I don't have as much power.
 And so I think in taking on Valkyrie,
 this character that wants to feel really powerful,
 not masculine necessarily,
 but I thought a lot about that in terms of body position.
 And then also just getting buff helped.
 - And then to dust off a question
 from the David Harbour episode,
 what do you think is the best on ramp to Shakespeare
 for those of us who've sworn off the work
 since reading Macbeth in 10th grade?
 (laughs)
 - I mean, I got really into Shakespeare,
 but it was not, it took me a while.
 So I was like, what is this?
 Doesn't make sense.
 I think the truth is the first time I saw it
 perform really well, it was crystal clear.
 But Cliff's Notes is Shakespeare for dummies.
 (laughs)
 - Get me back on the train.
 - Wauhaken.
 Okay, I'm into this.
 I like Moscow.
 - Kind of a step up.
 - Oh, really?
 - Not to lead the witness.
 - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 You know how the last ones take a minute?
 This one is like, mm-hmm.
 - Let's you know right away.
 It's pepper forward.
 - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 This might be my favorite so far.
 - There we go.
 - It's dancing, if the last one was dancing
 in the back of the tongue, this one is
 da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da on the front.
 - And maybe even wearing shoes this time.
 - It might be wearing shoes, not stilettos.
 It's still comfy, but it's reminding you it exists.
 - There we go.
 - Can I ask you a question?
 - Whatever you want.
 - The first sip of water, is that like a deduction?
 In terms of--
 - No, no, whatever.
 We want it to be the most comfortable,
 least comfortable interview.
 You know what I mean?
 So if you need a water, a sip of milk,
 and you've got some lifelines and some unique lifelines.
 - I have bread, I have, I got rice.
 I'm taking care.
 - There we go, totally.
 You're in good hands over here.
 So last year you launched a production company,
 Viva Mod, something that I've always been curious about.
 Are there certain kinds of stories
 that are harder to adapt than others?
 - Yeah, like all the ones I wanna adapt.
 (laughing)
 No, but also I really love books.
 I love reading books, and so there's a lot of novels
 that we're trying to adapt, and it's ambitious,
 'cause they're sprawling, and also,
 there are things that you can do on the page
 in terms of articulating ideas and thoughts of a character,
 and how do you communicate that in film language?
 It takes some real consideration.
 (gentle music)
 I'm doing great.
 Okay.
 Hmm.
 Hmm.
 - Dancing on it a little bit.
 - Mm-hmm.
 I love this one.
 It's really smooth throughout.
 It's, if I dare say so myself, a little,
 it's feist, it's kinky.
 - Oh, I like that.
 - It's feisty.
 - (laughing) There we go.
 - You know what I mean?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Yeah. - I think you're a tagline, yeah.
 I'm gonna switch up the tagline, I think.
 - It's, you know, no, no, no, maybe the better word is,
 is it zesty?
 - It's got some zest.
 - Okay, it's zest.
 - I'd say it's got some zest, but I like kinky.
 We're gonna go with kinky.
 - Okay.
 - It's bindy, it stands.
 So it's rare for us to interview a Hollywood star
 who's actually from LA, but we're happy to put you
 in the pantheon alongside Elizabeth Olsen
 and Kristen Stewart.
 - Elizabeth Olsen, by the way, is my favorite Hot Ones
 interview of all time.
 - You know what, I saw you in New York City.
 - In New York City.
 (laughing)
 The amount, I did that for a long time,
 even when I was not in New York City.
 I was in a New York City state of mind.
 Well, I'm in New York City.
 That interview meant a lot to me,
 from forwards to backwards.
 That's why I'm wearing a blazer,
 and she's wearing a blazer, so.
 - That's a good Easter egg, I love that.
 (laughing)
 Do you think that there's something about being
 from the heart of the entertainment industry
 that affects the way that you view it,
 or is it reductive to think that actors from LA
 have a certain sensibility?
 - No, I don't think it's reductive.
 I think that's probably true.
 It also depends on how you come into the industry,
 even especially living in Los Angeles.
 For me, Hollywood was not so much an institution,
 'cause I didn't know anybody at it.
 Like, where all the stars are, Marilyn Monroe's hands
 and feet, like, that was basically my front yard.
 In the same way that I saw this romance around people
 would come to LA on this pilgrimage for a dream,
 I was like, well, I wanna go on a pilgrimage for a dream.
 I just don't know where.
 And then once I realized that acting is what I wanted to do
 and storytelling is what I wanted to do,
 I was like, well, here I am, I guess.
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 - Ooh, Reaper, okay.
 - Mm, you know Reaper.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Climbing.
 - It's stagey.
 - Yeah, right, it comes in waves a little bit.
 - Yeah, it's like, mm.
 - Right, and then you think you're good, and then?
 - And then it's like, it hasn't hit me with the full.
 A little bit there.
 (laughing)
 As if it heard me.
 - I think they do sometimes, you know?
 - You think they do?
 But this is nice, it's settling on my tongue nicely.
 - There we go.
 - In the back part of it.
 - Fully soaked, fully marinated,
 and while you sit in that marinade, Tessa Thompson,
 we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That Gram.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 - No.
 - And for the first time in years, after this long hiatus,
 the laptop is back, camera guy Bill.
 - Hey.
 - Can you still do it?
 There we go, he's still got it.
 So we'll show you the picture,
 you just tell us the bigger story.
 As a self-described people watcher
 who also studied cultural anthropology,
 what's your take on Comic-Con?
 - Ooh, Comic-Con's cool,
 and I got to do it really anthropologically
 because I stole a Stormtrooper uniform
 and I walked the floor.
 The whole time, people were like,
 you can't walk the floor, A, you don't have time,
 and also it would be just too chaotic,
 and so I just borrowed one of these things
 and took to the floor, and it was so fun.
 I wish I could do that just for a day,
 and also I'd love to be able to plan a real costume
 and a real look, but really spend Comic-Con that way.
 And also to be there with someone like Chris Hemsworth.
 I mean, you see the face I'm making in there,
 I'm like, ooh, people are really into him.
 - All right, that concludes Explain That Gram.
 Bill?
 - Got it.
 - Looking good, bud.
 - Thank you, working out.
 - All right, you ready to move on here to the back half,
 Collared and Ghost here in the sick spot?
 - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay.
 - Little bit of a different color.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Uh-huh, it's a lot of saliva happening in my mouth.
 It's getting watery in there.
 (laughing)
 - So you've worked closely with director Ryan Coogler
 and have interesting thoughts about how to take something
 with the size and scale of a Hollywood blockbuster,
 but still give it a real point of view.
 What have you learned by working with each other
 about navigating the intersection of art and commerce?
 - Oh, that's such a good question.
 I think it's amazing to have your own autonomy
 to get to do whatever you want,
 but it's also incredible to be able to make something
 that you know a lot of people are gonna be able to see
 and especially on a global scale.
 And that's such a rare gift
 that not that many filmmakers make,
 and particularly filmmakers that come so steeped
 in the independent world.
 You get so much access,
 and sometimes I think there is this thing
 of like, "More money, more problems."
 You know, as soon as you have money,
 there are people really telling you how to spend it.
 But I've never seen someone deal with that
 more gracefully than Ryan.
 I also think so much you make these things
 and you put them out into the world
 and they're not yours anymore anyways, you know?
 Which is the beautiful and terrifying thing about them.
 (laughs)
 - All right, you are doing so good.
 - Okay.
 - You're approaching this home stretch here.
 This next one is "Tyrfiend's Curse" here in the seventh spot.
 - Okay.
 - From "Halo Ghee."
 - Mm-hmm.
 (dramatic music)
 Mm-hmm.
 (laughs)
 It's building.
 (laughs)
 One of those.
 - Yeah.
 - It is a little bit of that.
 It's a slight watering of the eyes,
 but it's not a bad thing.
 - And then this is where I'll just say,
 "Be careful," you know, because--
 - Don't touch the eyes.
 - Don't touch the eyes.
 You know, your instinct, you'll want to,
 but avoid at all costs.
 - How often do people drool?
 - Oh, every episode.
 - Okay, cool.
 - Go ahead and let it fly.
 - Okay, not now.
 I might wait until I get to nine.
 - As a musician yourself,
 how would you distill the experience
 of working alongside composer Ludwig Goransson
 to make original music for "Creed?"
 Like, I imagine that's a unique experience
 to create music in the context of a film
 from the perspective of your character.
 - Yeah, that was so wild too,
 because we basically locked ourselves
 in a studio for two weeks,
 and then we'd have friends of him come over
 and write with us, like Donald Glover,
 and Sam Du, and Moses Sumney,
 and all these incredible artists.
 And, you know, I've dabbled in music,
 but I'm not like them.
 They can, like, do anything.
 They could eat, like, two cutting boards
 of these hot wings, you know,
 and then, like, sit down and sing.
 It also felt like preparation for the role.
 It was kind of like a fake it till you make it.
 I don't know.
 You know what I mean.
 (Tessa laughs)
 This one's getting to me.
 - All right, Tessa, are you ready to move on here
 to the next wing?
 - Mm-hmm.
 - It brings me no joy to say this,
 but this is "Da Bomb Beyond Insanity."
 - Mm-hmm.
 (dramatic music)
 (Tessa exhales)
 Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 (Tessa hums)
 - Yeah.
 - Ah.
 - Yeah.
 - Ah.
 The jump between this and that is-
 - Is exponential.
 (both laugh)
 ♪ Oh yeah ♪
 Does this work?
 - You told me I won't-
 - No, it makes it worse, no, it makes it worse.
 It rubs it, no, it makes it worse.
 - Yeah, it's like taking a cut
 and rubbing it on the carpet or something.
 - Okay, okay, let me see what happens.
 - Yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 - Mm.
 Mm.
 Mm-hmm.
 - Yep.
 That's all you.
 - Is this a good thing to do?
 - Yeah.
 - Anything you can do to survive,
 and I'll gas pedal it here to the finish line.
 (dramatic music)
 Do you have a lasting memory from being a Bar Mitzvah dancer?
 That seems like such an interesting job,
 you know, getting people from age 13 to 95
 to rally to the dance floor.
 That seems like a new challenge
 for even the most seasoned entertainer.
 - Uh-huh.
 (Tessa laughs)
 Mm-hmm.
 (both laugh)
 Hmm.
 Mm.
 What was the question?
 - Bar Mitzvah dancer.
 - Mm.
 - Did you have a lasting memory,
 or how would you distill the experience?
 - Mm-hmm.
 It was a lot of spandex.
 A lot of wrangling grannies.
 And, um.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 A lot of horas.
 - A what?
 - Uh, nah.
 (both laugh)
 Hora, you know?
 When they put you in the chair and hoist you up,
 I'm fully crying.
 - Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
 - It's 'cause, um,
 really dancing at Bar Mitzvah brings up memories.
 (Tessa laughs)
 For me.
 I think really,
 the experience of
 being there
 on such a pivotal time in, um,
 family's lives,
 being able to
 support that, be a part of it,
 get everybody moving and dancing.
 It kept the lights on.
 This is fully clearing my sinuses.
 - Yeah.
 A transcendent experience.
 Something that, you know, you walk through,
 get to the other side,
 and you're a changed person at the end of it.
 - Mm-hmm.
 When does the mouth, when does it,
 when does it go away?
 - It's a nightmare.
 A show I have to apologize for.
 (Tessa laughs)
 - I love it, man.
 It makes me feel alive.
 (dramatic music)
 - The Dingo Psycho Sauce from Australia.
 - Oh!
 - I know you recently spent some time in Australia.
 - Yeah.
 - This is the taste of Australia.
 - Let me eat this Dingo, baby.
 (Tessa laughs)
 Ready?
 - I'm ready.
 (dramatic music)
 And this one sucks,
 but I think after the last one.
 - Are we done?
 - There's something about this
 that's just a little bit easier.
 - Oh.
 (dramatic music)
 Yeah, it's not as bad.
 - Right.
 All downhill from here.
 All downhill from here, Tessa.
 As a thrift store vet,
 do you have a vintage secondhand clothing hack
 that you can share with the people?
 We've had past Hot Ones guests extol the virtues
 of shape over all else when it comes to vintage tees.
 - Yeah, shape is good,
 but you know, I have a really weird thing,
 which is I feel like,
 and this is gonna sound really crazy,
 I get a hit.
 I got a feeling what I need
 when there's a vintage thing somewhere for me.
 - Oh, like a six cents.
 - Yeah.
 And I'm like, I gotta go to this place today.
 I feel that sometimes.
 I don't know if it's just that I'm like in the need
 for retail therapy or something,
 but that's my advice is to try to channel the vintage gods
 for when you might need to get to a place
 to look for some things.
 - All right, Tessa Thompson.
 Reach it for it, she knows.
 - I'm gonna, I made it this far.
 - I saw that coming.
 - Okay.
 - Cheers, Tessa.
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Yep.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 Mm-hmm.
 (laughing)
 - That one will make you spin in your bar chair,
 as Queen Latifah would say.
 (laughing)
 - It's a spicy meatball.
 But the good thing, Tessa Thompson,
 like Valkyrie battling the god butcher,
 we've taken on the wings of death,
 lived to tell the tale,
 and just one blind spot in our interview,
 and that's Tessa Thompson and goats.
 - Yeah.
 - You know, you've talked about similarities
 that you have with goats,
 but what I'm interested here on Wing 10
 is your personal goats.
 So with your brain on fire and mouth ablaze,
 I'll hit you with some categories.
 You just give me the Tessa Thompson greatest of all time.
 - Okay, great.
 - Goat craft service snack.
 - Mm.
 - Spicy hot Cheez-Its.
 - There we go.
 Goat movie adapted from a book.
 - Ooh.
 Ooh.
 Talented Mr. Ripley.
 - Goat hot sauce.
 - Ooh, some pirate hot sauce amazingness.
 - Pirate's Lantern, maybe.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - We've actually had that on the show before.
 Pirate's Lantern, put it on the throne,
 because Tessa Thompson said so,
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Mm.
 There's so many things to enjoy.
 This week, I'm gonna go to London,
 and I'm gonna eat curry,
 because it's the national dish there.
 It's the best place to eat curry.
 Our movie is gonna,
 I think it's gonna come out,
 and people are gonna see it,
 and I'm hoping with all this talk of goats
 that I have some time to spend with goats
 in some secret situations.
 I don't mean that in like a weird way.
 I just mean that I wanna have more access.
 I feel like this might give me more access to goats
 than I've had before.
 (clapping)
 I did it, right?
 You crushed it.
 - I have been asked, ever since my family found out
 I was coming on the show,
 and friends of mine,
 I get asked constantly when it's happening.
 Everyone is so excited,
 and also it very much is a moment of like,
 oh, you've made it.
 Like, you're going to Hot Ones.
 - Oh, Marvel, like whatever.
 - You're big time.
 No, really and truly, like they were shocking.
 (screaming)
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on Hot Ones fans?
 Thank you so much for watching today's video.
 The season 18 sauces, they're here,

 Dom, box me.
