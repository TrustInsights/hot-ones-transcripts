 - I took a pic with me.
 - Yeah, yeah, I know you did, I know you did,
 but that's enough, that's plenty, right?
 (laughing)
 (dramatic music)
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Gal Gadot.
 - Hello.
 - She's a box office blockbuster factor you know
 from films like Wonder Woman, Batman vs. Superman,
 the Fast and Furious franchise, and many more.
 You can also catch her starring in the brand new
 Netflix spy thriller Heart of Stone,
 which is set to begin streaming on August 11th.
 Gal Gadot, welcome to the show.
 - Hello, hello.
 - How are you around spicy food?
 Are you at all nervous going into this?
 - I am extremely nervous.
 I'm, I love food.
 I like, like some spice to it,
 but I'm not strong on spicy food.
 - Well, today you will be.
 Are you ready to get started?
 - Yes, I'm too nervous, so let's just start it.
 Can you imagine if I would go to the hottest one?
 - I have an eye for it.
 Like Tom Holland came on here
 and went for the last one immediately.
 And we were on it.
 Like Dom, she was like Secret Service taking a bullet,
 like coming on set.
 So don't worry, don't worry, we got you.
 But this first one, and you'll start at the handle.
 - Yes.
 - The classic chili maple.
 - This one.
 - That one right there.
 - Smells delish.
 - Right?
 - I'm hungry.
 We're going for it, right?
 See, I'm ready.
 - I'm gonna take another one.
 - All right, let's go.
 - 'Cause I'm hungry.
 - Let's go, let's go crazy now.
 - And I can with the later one, let's see.
 Over.
 Good.
 - So in Heart of Stone, you play the role
 of an international intelligence agent.
 Rachel Stone, it's a very physical performance
 that includes everything from motorcycle chases
 to gun battles to paragliding down dark mountainside.
 How did the physicality of this role compare
 to some of the other backbreaking characters
 that you've played over the years?
 - Woo, you know something?
 I feel like from one movie to the other, to the next,
 the bar just keeps on going up and up and up.
 And every time I feel like, okay, this was the most,
 I'm never gonna be able to,
 then the next movie comes along
 and the action is even more crazy.
 And at the same time, it's also, you know,
 I didn't want this to be another Wonder Woman film.
 So the whole idea was to create a film
 that would be grounded and the action would be raw
 and dynamic and like when she gets the hit,
 you feel the pain with her.
 So it's a lot different and we had to work out
 and train and prep for months before even filming this film.
 And it was awesome.
 It was great.
 I feel the spice, but that one I can definitely handle.
 - Mm, with the curry.
 - Yeah, you like it, I can see it.
 Look at that happy dance.
 - I love food.
 When it's good to me.
 How did you even start this thing?
 - So Chris is actually here again.
 Like Chris- - Where's Chris?
 Raise your hand. - Where's Chris?
 Raise your hand, there he is, right there.
 In the white polo over there.
 So a celebrity guest is often in like a PR driven
 flight pattern when they're doing media.
 Like what can we do to disrupt that, you know?
 And then Chris was like, well, what if we had them
 eat increasingly spicy chicken wings over the course
 of the interview as a way to break them down?
 And I was like, you're a genius.
 And that was like eight years ago.
 - You're a genius.
 You're a sadistic.
 How can we break our guests?
 - Right, and look at how he's at a safe distance.
 He's nowhere near these wings, you know what I'm saying, Gal?
 You know, I'm just like a sacrificial lamb in all of this.
 But that was eight years ago and over 300 episodes.
 And here we are in the 21st season.
 - That's amazing.
 - Yeah, so it's just the dumb idea that worked.
 - So you guys are fire.
 Like our daughter knows about this.
 This is like the thing.
 - We still got the kids.
 We still got the kids.
 - You have the next generation.
 No, but you have like us, but also the next generation.
 - We're bridging it.
 - It's pretty amazing.
 - Thank you.
 Thank you, I really appreciate that.
 - Yeah, always.
 Okay, lemon pepper.
 Just so you know, I got some tips from friends.
 - What were the tips?
 - Try not to let her touch the lips, breathe like this.
 Oh, you got a kick of spice.
 - I did.
 - I'm doing really well.
 - I'm no superhero, all right?
 I'm no Wonder Woman over here.
 - Do this, Ali Abbas, who's with me,
 she's in the cast of Heart of Stone.
 She's Indian.
 I asked her, are you good with,
 like how are you doing with spicy food?
 She was like, I travel around the world
 with like a bottle of spicy sauce.
 So she said, breathe like this.
 (breathing heavily)
 Just like that.
 That if I do this, it's not good.
 It's just like oxygen to the flame.
 - That makes sense to me.
 - Another one or no?
 We move on.
 Ah, you finished the whole thing.
 - You know what, I beat you to it.
 I beat you to it.
 I'm just showing off over here.
 Pound for pound, what's the fight sequence
 or battle scene that made your jaw drop the most
 when you saw it for the first time on the silver screen?
 - Um, Wonder Woman, I must say that when I was watching
 the second Wonder Woman, and it starts with this sequence
 of young Wonder Woman fighting,
 all of the, I got so emotional.
 It was like me seeing, as me being a eight year old girl
 watching like an amazing girl doing amazing things.
 That was emotionally effective on me.
 - Smoked garlic, raw sugar, and ginger root.
 - Wow.
 (breathing heavily)
 - It comes and goes, that's the thing.
 It's like it comes in waves.
 - That's what we're at.
 We're on like a little bit of a wave here.
 We're on a little bit of a wave.
 - I'm fine.
 - I can see it, I can see it.
 - You, you're, are you okay?
 - You know, I'm 300 episodes, gal.
 You know what I'm saying?
 - You should be.
 - You're putting those city miles on.
 You know what I'm saying?
 - Okay, and now it's gonna be like this big of a jump
 from one chicken to the next one?
 - I'm gonna be so honest with you this entire way.
 This entire way.
 So that was a little bit of a hot four.
 We call that one like a hot four,
 a little bit of a hot four.
 Five I think will go down a little bit,
 and that's, and then I'll clue you into each one
 as we go, all right?
 - That's exciting.
 - So we're in a good spot, we're in a good spot.
 You're almost halfway there and you're doing great.
 - Okay.
 You know all the talk shows, I don't know,
 in Israel at least, they have these games,
 like a TV game that you can play.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Like on a million dollars,
 and then if it's, nevermind, it's like that.
 They have like eight questions,
 and if they answer all eight, they get a million, whatever.
 I feel like I'm in a game.
 - Yeah, well that's interesting.
 You know, like--
 - Will you give me a million bucks?
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, take a look at the studio.
 Take a look at the studio.
 You think we got a million bucks?
 - But maybe that's why, you know,
 because the gift is so generous.
 - That's right.
 The margins, the margins are great.
 - Exactly.
 You don't need much.
 Okay.
 So easy, too easy.
 - Too, okay, I'll remember you said that.
 - Okay, ready?
 - I'm ready.
 - Okay.
 Smoking.
 - Mm-hmm.
 And--
 - Slow release.
 - We have that cumulative effect going, you know?
 Where five adds to four, which added to three, two,
 you know?
 (exhaling)
 (shushing)
 (laughing)
 - Great.
 - It's happening, it's happening.
 What's the most bonkers car stunt
 that you've ever seen with your own eyes
 or heard about secondhand on a Fast and Furious set?
 - When we were filming,
 we were filming in one of the Canary Islands
 and they shut the roads there
 and they literally set a huge truck
 and a bunch of very expensive cars on fire during the day.
 It was just like a, like you do with a match box.
 Fast and Furious, every set piece that they have
 with the cars, trains, rockets, airplanes,
 all these different vehicles are insane.
 - It's crazy.
 - It's crazy.
 Are you good?
 - Every new experience, I just try to survive it.
 Just the same as everyone else, you know what I mean?
 - I don't know how Chris did, Chris, right?
 - Yes.
 - How you, like you don't even alternate?
 Why is that?
 You don't know how to interview people?
 - Yeah, why isn't there like a bullpen or something?
 - You don't care about people,
 you're not interested in people.
 - He doesn't care.
 - Like that.
 - I'm just a chicken wing.
 - You're talented and you get the heat, literally for it.
 - I'm a chicken wing garbage disposal.
 - And the deal is like 50/50?
 - I don't know, I should check out his paperwork.
 Who knows?
 Who knows?
 Gal, you got a good lawyer?
 - I do.
 - All right, so you can trade some info after this.
 (laughing)
 - Mm, it smells delish though.
 - That was good.
 That was good.
 - Was it?
 - No, no.
 - That was a nice big bite.
 Right, this is a different world.
 I know, I know, I know.
 I know, I know how it goes, I know how it goes.
 I know, and then this is, be careful around your eyes.
 You know, like don't touch face, eyes.
 - It's sweaty.
 My tongue is sweating.
 - I know, I know.
 - I can see it, I can see it.
 - I'm so hot.
 Oh my God.
 It's so hot.
 Okay.
 - Okay.
 No problem.
 - You know something though?
 - No problem.
 - It's a journey.
 - That's right, and it's all about the journey.
 - You know the people that whatever they do,
 it's a journey?
 - Yes.
 - It's a journey.
 - Through the spicy wings.
 - Through the, it's a spicy journey.
 It's a,
 it's like when I work out and it's leg day.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - It's leg day.
 So I always do this.
 Ah, I hate it.
 But actually, I should say, I love it.
 And release the leavens, right?
 And just go for it.
 I love spicy.
 - Exactly.
 Spicy is the shit.
 - Exactly.
 And you know what?
 It's the pain in the legs that's your legs getting stronger.
 You know what I mean?
 - Exactly, my tongue.
 - And the pain, everything, right.
 - I'm killing all of my taste buds.
 All at once.
 Wow, it's really like.
 - Non-stop.
 - Yeah, this one is good.
 Like, he's evil.
 I'm not following you.
 I'm just going for it by myself.
 - Here we go.
 (dramatic music)
 - I don't know, maybe it's because I'm already burnt.
 - Right.
 - I don't feel anything.
 - That we're just in the wild and free over here.
 - I'm like, after a numb.
 You numbed my tongue.
 - Right.
 Once your tongue sweats it out on leg day,
 you're good to go.
 - My tongue is so, my tongue is so sweaty.
 Because it dilutes all the spicy from the chicken.
 - Yeah, but here's what I will say.
 - Uh-huh.
 - It was what happens with hot food.
 Is sometimes you bite into it, you think you're doing good.
 And then one of those waves kind of hits.
 But it looks like the water's crashing against the shore
 and you're doing just fine over here, gal.
 - And this is number what?
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
 - Seven, you're all the way up to seven.
 You're doing so good.
 You're doing so good.
 - Cut to me in the hospital.
 Like something happened to my stomach.
 They're trying to figure out what,
 there's holes everywhere in my digestive system.
 Okay.
 - So someone who's the founding member
 of a mac and cheese brand.
 - Yes.
 - Like shout out to Goodles.
 What do you think is the key to a perfect bowl
 of mac and cheese in your opinion?
 - A good bowl of mac and cheese is one that is rich,
 creamy, that every bite while you,
 is melting in your mouth and you're just craving
 to go to the next bite.
 That it's salty, but it's also has a touch of sweetness to it.
 - I'm there, I'm there, I'm there right with you.
 I'm there right with you.
 - How did we not bring a bowl of mac and cheese
 to Goodles?
 You poor thing, you've done it 300 times.
 - And I know what it is and I know what it means
 and I know it's about to happen.
 - Okay.
 I feel like I'm eating death.
 - That's exactly what it is.
 - Is that enough?
 No.
 - I think it's plenty, but you let me know.
 - Yeah.
 Right.
 And it doesn't stop.
 And this is gonna grow from here too.
 You know what I have to say?
 In my eight years of doing this show,
 I don't feel like I've ever had a guest
 so perfect in their nonverbal communication as you.
 (dramatic music)
 How we feeling?
 Okay, okay.
 I'm just interpreting this abstract dance over here.
 Oh, careful, careful around the eyes,
 careful around the eyes.
 Yeah, there we go.
 - That's better, that's better, that's better.
 - Is there an underrated Israeli snack
 that you think more Americans should know about?
 Like something that you think
 has real mainstream crossover potential?
 - What?
 - I know, I know, it's crazy.
 I get it, I get it.
 To come out the other side, I get it, I get it.
 - And you've done it 300 times?
 - Yeah, that sauce in particular, believe it or not.
 And probably like more just from like sort of like ancillary
 like shoulder things that I've done over the years.
 You know what I mean?
 I've been here and what you're going through,
 I've been here lots of times.
 - It's like ninja-ing.
 - Right, all around.
 - My back of my everything.
 - Stop, I know, I know.
 It doesn't stop, it doesn't stop.
 - It's like, you know how I felt?
 - How did it feel, how did it feel?
 - At one point, it's hard to talk.
 - Yeah, yeah, no, that's, yeah,
 we made an interview show where it's hard to talk,
 I get it.
 - Remember Harry Potter when he comes to
 and he sucks the life out of him?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Like that.
 - Right, but it's just, yeah.
 - Suck the life out of him.
 It's like, what is happening?
 And you can't stop, it's still going.
 - No, I know, I know.
 You know, and like when you went for the ears,
 that was interesting to me.
 - Really?
 - Because, yeah, I used to,
 there's a guy named Chili Klaus,
 who's also like a spicy pepper eater
 in like the YouTube space.
 And one time we ate a Carolina.
 (spitting)
 As one does.
 And one time we ate a Carolina Reaper,
 the hottest pepper in the world,
 and he would snap to remind himself
 that he's not going deaf.
 - Yeah, I don't know why I did it.
 There is a delicious wafer.
 You know, you like chocolate wafer?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my--
 - Called Totit, which I love.
 There is, I'm trying to think about stuff
 that you don't actually have here like we do.
 And there's not much, there's not much.
 You guys are doing pretty good on snacks,
 I might tell you.
 - You know, and hot sauce too,
 maybe there's like some thing--
 - Hot sauce too.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Or maybe not.
 Let's leave it here, you enjoy it.
 Israel has enough going on, you know.
 Okay, fuck it, it's it.
 - Okay, fuck it, let's do it.
 Now, not fun, you know,
 by any stretch of the imagination,
 but it's got that watermelon's
 kind of refreshing up front,
 kick back, right, right, right.
 I get it.
 With me.
 Okay.
 So in 2004, you won Miss Israel,
 even though I know that it was far
 from your focus at the time.
 Was there anything that surprised you most
 about the behind the scenes of a beauty pageant?
 You know, like savage gamesmanship backstage
 or like ways to ace certain categories?
 - Wow, so when I went to Miss Israel,
 in Israel, to begin with,
 I went for the experience
 and so I can tell my grandkids
 that grandma was blah, blah, blah.
 And then I won.
 And it was shocking.
 I never meant to win.
 I came for fun and all of the sudden I felt,
 it's funny, you're 18,
 you're taking things very, you know, seriously.
 The only part that I enjoyed doing
 was like the opening sequence with the dance.
 - Yeah, I can tell, I can see it in you.
 I've been seeing it in you all afternoon.
 - That I could not, you know,
 you can take the girl out of the city.
 You can take the, so yeah,
 that was my experience with,
 yeah, you wanna go for the Apollo, huh?
 - You saw, you saw it right away.
 - Why are you shaking it?
 We really going for it?
 - We're going for it.
 - Okay, just tell me what to do.
 What to expect.
 - Glory.
 - Glory.
 - 'Cause it'll all be over.
 The whole thing will be behind you
 and you will have reached the top of the mountain.
 - Maybe when my daughter watches it,
 she'll be so proud.
 - Proud, so proud.
 And you'll be like.
 - And I just do it for Alma and Maya and Daniela.
 Really?
 - For the girls.
 - Yeah.
 Okay.
 Is it delicious?
 - It actually is kind of good,
 to be honest with you.
 It's very hot, but.
 - I just got a.
 A reminder.
 - A reminder from the bum.
 Okay, just a tiny, tiny one.
 - Yeah.
 Perfect, perfect.
 Oh, that's intense.
 - Really?
 - I'm locked in, gal.
 I'm locked in.
 - Let's see who's gonna blink first.
 This is nothing, dude.
 - No problem.
 You blinked.
 - Fuck.
 (laughing)
 - That's all right, I have a lot of practice.
 And what we're gonna do is put your dialogue exercises
 to the test here, to close things out, all right?
 Do you have a favorite tongue twister vocal warmup?
 And if so, can we try it with our tongues
 and mouths on fire?
 Yeah?
 Finding it.
 - Do you wanna do a Hebrew one?
 - Yeah.
 - That'll be easy for me.
 (speaking in Hebrew)
 - One more time.
 (speaking in Hebrew)
 - You're so good.
 - Wow, well, you know what?
 No, gal, you are so good.
 - Just like that.
 - Taking on the wings of death and living to tell the tale.
 And now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Thank you so much.
 - What do you mean?
 (laughing)
 - Do you have a movie coming out or anything?
 - Oh, oh, why we're here.
 Everybody, this is Gal Gadot.
 Please enjoy, no, let me do it again.
 I can't even think.
 It's a miracle I speak English right now.
 - Take two.
 - Hey everyone, that was me, Gal Gadot.
 I hope you enjoy Heart of Stone
 coming out on August 11th on Netflix.
 (clapping)
 That was nice.
 I mean, nice.
 That was like a journey.
 That was an experience.
 The fact that you've been doing this for eight years
 is incredible.
 (clapping)
 And it is so unique.
 You like cracked an angle on how,
 that also you get so,
 like there's no masks.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Look at, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - You know, so it's like you get what's real.
 You get all the real.
 - Spicy is the shit.
 (dramatic music)
 - Thank you so much for watching today's video.
