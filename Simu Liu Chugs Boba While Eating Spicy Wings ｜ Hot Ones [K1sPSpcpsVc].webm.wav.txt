 (dramatic music)
 - I'm sorry, Sean, there's a lot of liquid in me right now.
 - No, no, make no apologies.
 - I apologize.
 - Make no apologies.
 - My behavior, no, this is not how my mother raised me.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on, everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Simu Liu.
 He's the actor of course stars in 2021's
 highest grossing box office film,
 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,
 which you can currently find streaming on Disney+.
 Today though, it's the Legend of the Ten Wings.
 Howly fair, I guess only time will tell.
 Simu, welcome to the show.
 - I knew that was the only reason I was on the show.
 And fair enough, we got the pun out nice and early.
 I'm glad.
 Kind of wondering why I agreed to this.
 No, no, it's such an honor.
 It's such an honor to be here, Sean.
 Thank you for having me.
 I can already smell it and it's already up my nose.
 (dramatic music)
 - Perfect.
 - Cheers. - Cheers.
 - Great.
 Okay.
 (gentle music)
 All right.
 What have you got for me?
 (laughing)
 - So, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,
 it features a Hollywood hall of fame ensemble
 of action movie legends from The Matrix's Bill Pope
 to members of Jackie Chan's stunt team
 to your co-star, Tony Leung.
 What was the most challenging
 or gnarly wire work scene to pull off?
 Director, Destin Daniel Cretton,
 described the runaway bus
 that's in the Act One fight sequence
 as being a claustrophobic barf machine.
 (laughing)
 - That's fair, that's fair.
 That was a gnarly sequence.
 I mean, we took two San Francisco minibuses.
 We shipped them to Sydney, Australia.
 We gutted them, put them up on airbags and gimbals.
 It was basically like, imagine a Disneyland ride, right?
 So every day you go to work, you get this like ladder.
 You walk up into this suspended bus like 50 feet in the air
 and then it just starts twisting and moving
 and I must've like banged my knees and shins
 and elbows and forehead on like every single
 possible appendage of that bus.
 So the last take that I did,
 I think we had already gotten the shot.
 So of course it's always that last one
 that you shouldn't do that ends up being the one
 that you get injured on.
 But I was like, let me do one more, let me do one more.
 I can totally do it better.
 And I remember being like, I'm gonna give it
 like just the best baseball slide.
 So I went straight in and there was this little tiny piece
 jutting out of the roof of the bus.
 And for some reason my kneecap went straight into it.
 And I was down and out for a hot sec.
 I like it, Sean.
 Is that all you got?
 Don't put it in my back.
 I didn't just say that.
 That's a bad idea.
 - The two wings and confidence.
 You know, I never get sick of that.
 So early in your career, you produced, starred
 and wrote a handful of short films,
 many of which I was able to find.
 I was able to track down
 on the Wong Fu Productions YouTube channel.
 What is it that you find sacred about shorts?
 'Cause I think for a lot of people,
 the annual Academy Award nominations,
 that represents the entirety of what they know
 about the art form.
 - This is the big thing about short films,
 is that they're affordable.
 - Yeah, keep that under $10,000 budget.
 - Exactly, exactly.
 When you're a starving artist
 and you're just trying to look for ways to create content,
 try to get things going,
 you can't necessarily fund an entire feature film.
 And so you do a short, oftentimes it's a proof of concept
 or just something that you can show off to be like,
 "Hey, this is a calling card.
 "I want more opportunities to do this,
 "maybe on a bigger scale."
 But I first saw Wong Fu, I was in high school.
 It was like YouTube was just starting to be a thing.
 First of all, there are a bunch of Asian American filmmakers
 who, you know, at a time when those opportunities
 didn't exist in the system,
 they went out and made their own luck.
 They just went out and they were like,
 "Screw it, I'm gonna create."
 And people are gonna watch it.
 And that's exactly what happened.
 And for so many of us,
 for millions of diasporic Asian youth,
 that was the only representation that we had
 for a really, really long time.
 So I have all the respect in the world for those guys.
 I continue to wanna work with them
 and they're the best.
 I can keep this one down,
 but I'm not letting myself get overconfident.
 I feel it building and I feel, "Mm."
 - It's settling.
 - Like I don't need to go to the boba yet.
 - On the topic of the boba though,
 you know, boba guys, mutual friends of ours,
 came through, so we have two of them.
 So this is the jasmine one that you like, right?
 You like the green jasmine.
 - Love me some jasmine milk tea, yep.
 - And then this one they actually made for me.
 They call it the antidote
 with like a horchata sort of base to it.
 So they actually made this for me on like the spicy food.
 - Yeah, yeah, you wanna try it?
 - Oh yeah.
 Oh yeah, it's soothing.
 (laughing)
 It's soothing.
 - So before becoming a Marvel superhero,
 I know that your first job out of college
 was at a big four accounting firm.
 Is there anything that you learned being an accountant
 that's actually helped you
 now that you're depositing Disney checks?
 (laughing)
 - I learned that I was a terrible accountant.
 My error rate was so high.
 Like literally every spreadsheet that I ever sent in,
 I would get it back immediately
 and it would just be marked completely in red
 and my supervisors were just like,
 I don't know what to do with you.
 Like I know, and you know, I would like check my work.
 I would like, you know,
 I obviously didn't want to be bad at my job,
 but I just couldn't do it.
 Sometimes it's just things aren't meant to be in the universe
 and thank God for that because--
 - Because you had a different calling.
 - Exactly.
 - And then speaking of those odd jobs to start,
 from college brochures to billboards
 to the covers of textbooks,
 where is the strangest place that you've ever seen
 your Getty stock images pop up in real life?
 - I saw myself on the wall of a karate dojo,
 but you know, but we didn't do any karate photos
 in the stock shoot.
 So it was actually, it was a photo of,
 I think me doing Zumba.
 So I was like in this pose where I was smiling
 and doing one of these, one of these swings
 and it was in a martial arts dojo, so not great.
 Also, somewhat ironically,
 I was on the cover of an accounting textbook.
 I think it was like QuickBooks or something.
 And I was like, I don't know.
 I wouldn't trust me to teach anybody
 anything about accounting.
 (upbeat music)
 Okay, here we go.
 - Los Calientes, there it is.
 - There we go.
 - How many wings would you say you've had
 over the course of your entire Hot Ones career?
 - Well, you know, the accounting conversation
 is actually a nice segue into this kind of question
 because you know, we're probably 230 episodes in, right?
 10 wings an episode, that would put me squarely
 over 2,300 wings that I've eaten
 for the internet's amusement over the years.
 - So do you still enjoy wings outside of work or has it?
 - Nah, you know, there's a couple of things
 that have ruined it for me.
 First off, it feels like work, you know?
 Like that kind of thing.
 Plus I've eaten a lot of them.
 So it's like kind of the last thing that I want to eat.
 And then the other side of it is like, you know,
 I go to a restaurant or something and this is nice.
 I'm not complaining, but it's like somebody
 will come out of the kitchen like, oh, these are for you.
 And then there's like wings or like friends coming
 into town and they're like, where's the best place
 to get wings?
 Like, you know, everybody has kind of like--
 - You're the wing guy.
 - I've been typecast in acting terms as like the wing guy.
 So I think you sort of like start
 to then resent wings over time or something.
 - That's so funny that you say that
 because my fear in this movie and its success,
 and of course it's been very successful
 and we're very happy about it, is that it will perpetuate
 this kind of narrative that only, you know,
 the Asian people can only lead martial arts movies,
 which is not true, right?
 But of course it's something that, you know,
 I don't want people to constantly come up to me
 and be like, hey, I bet I could kick your ass.
 What do you think?
 You know?
 So I get that.
 I feel that, you know, wanting to, you know,
 be known for other things.
 - Exactly, already connecting, already connecting
 around Wing 4.
 But as long as people keep watching on YouTube,
 I'll keep throwing them down.
 (laughing)
 - He says as he gets an extra chunk of chicken in there.
 - Just a little off the bone, yeah.
 (upbeat music)
 - This one's a little bit of a step up.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - Feel that one.
 - This one will grow, it'll bellow a little bit.
 But while it's doing that, I'll set you up
 because we have a recurring segment on our show
 called Explain That, Graham.
 We do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 - Okay.
 - I know that you're a Star Wars diehard.
 Do you have an all-time favorite Jedi?
 - It's gotta be Qui-Gon Jinn.
 - All right.
 - That'd be Qui-Gon Jinn.
 - I feel like, look, I don't know how deep
 you are into Star Wars.
 - I'm going, I'm just following you down.
 - You're following me, all right.
 So this whole idea of the Jedi during the Old Republic
 just feels like, you know, if you look at those
 council scenes where everyone's so stuck up,
 they're all just like, oh, these are the rules.
 We don't ever break the rules.
 And there's no, and by the way, very hypocritical too,
 because the Jedi are supposed to not want power.
 They're like, we have no thirst for power.
 And there's literally like a council that oversees
 everything that's like in the highest part of Coruscant.
 So anyway, anyway, I just love that Qui-Gon is like
 a bit of a maverick, like he doesn't care.
 He's like, sorry, I'm gonna train this kid.
 And ultimately that kid is gonna grow up to become
 Darth Vader and overthrow the entire Republic.
 But still, you gotta admire the guy that can see through
 the hypocrisy of the Jedi Order, right?
 They think they're the good guys.
 They're like, oh yeah, we're so,
 but like, you know, really were the instruments
 of their own demise in a way.
 Sorry, I've already--
 - No, I love it.
 - You get me on a Star Wars tangent and I'm telling you,
 I will show you my true colors.
 Ooh.
 (laughing)
 That was involuntary.
 All right, keep continuing on.
 - That's why it was wise though to not get too far
 out in front, 'cause you know, hot sauce go like,
 it catches you and humbles you.
 - No, you're right, you're right, you're right.
 - When you least expect it.
 - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 This is number--
 - Six. - Six, all right.
 - Señor Lechuga.
 Yeah.
 - And there it is.
 (laughing)
 It's arrived.
 - So connecting the dots looking back,
 it would seem like your place in the MCU
 is basically Destiny.
 In fact, in your recent SNL monologue,
 you talked about how you played Spider-Man
 at kids' birthday parties to make ends meet as an actor.
 Were you ever goaded into breaking character
 by like a problem child or drunken adult?
 - Drunken adult, no, because they generally
 stayed out of my way because all they wanted to do
 was day drink with the other adults.
 That's kind of the whole point of having
 a birthday party Spider-Man, it's to like babysit your kids
 so that you can just go and do whatever.
 When you're doing these birthday parties,
 you gotta pay attention to the age, right?
 For some whatever friggin' reason,
 some parents will book a Spider-Man
 for like an eight year old party.
 And when you see it, you're like,
 "Oh, this is not gonna be good."
 'Cause eight year olds aren't gonna be into that.
 They're already starting to understand and internalize
 that movies aren't real.
 And so when you show up with a $25 Spider-Man suit
 that basically your boss got from a Target somewhere,
 that's not gonna be enough for them.
 Whew, that took a while.
 That like percolated for a little bit.
 Yeah, it kind of, yeah, it has that sort of volcanic
 sort of eruption to it, but you don't know
 when it's gonna go off.
 But do you think it might have primed the pipes
 for the next one?
 (laughing)
 You're the expert, Sean, you tell me.
 I think you just swing, you just swing big, you know?
 Let's do it.
 So this one is the bootle of fire here in the seventh spot.
 Okay.
 Mm.
 (dramatic music)
 Nice big one.
 We're not shying away from the bites here.
 Yeah.
 We've made it so far.
 I'm gonna have some jasmine.
 All right, cool, me too.
 For enjoyment.
 You know, I don't think we need to break out the antidote.
 Just yeah.
 Mm.
 Right?
 You might be onto something here.
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 So recently you received a hero's welcome
 at the Toronto premiere of "Shang-Chi,"
 actually having that massive welcome back billboard
 in the middle of downtown.
 What's the institutional significance of Square One
 for a young person growing up in Mississauga?
 My God, that's a deep cut.
 Square One, man, oh God, I'm impressed.
 Square One, first of all, Square One is by sheer size
 the largest mall in Ontario.
 That was the place to hang out.
 Especially if you're underage,
 you just hang out at the mall, you watch movies.
 One of my first jobs ever, I was a model
 at Evercoming Fitch. Oh shit.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Like shirt off in front of the store sort of thing going?
 Not in front of the store per se,
 just like inside taking in the fumes
 and folding clothes and pretending like I was a model.
 I remember too 'cause like when I was in high school,
 like some of my friends would be like,
 "Oh, like I got scouted."
 Or like, "One of my friends got scouted."
 And that's, you know, apparently a thing
 that would happen was like--
 "Oh, you look like a cool kid.
 "Like do you wanna work at Evercom?"
 And so I remember I wanted to be hot and cool so bad
 I would go to the stores and I would just hang out.
 Waiting to get scouted?
 Waiting to get scouted.
 And I would like try to do my hair and like, you know,
 never happen.
 And so I was so desperate that I literally just came in
 with a resume and I was like, "Hey guys, I would love to."
 And you know, and the manager at the time
 like kind of took pity on me and he was like,
 "Why don't you show up to this group interview?"
 I got hired and I ended up being an Evercom model.
 Proudest moment of my life.
 - Not sure if you've heard of this next one before.
 Da Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 - I think I've seen it before on this show.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Okay.
 - So this is that one.
 - Okay.
 Let's do it.
 - Let's do it. - Let's do it.
 - You can see it's got that.
 - You know what I'm not gonna do though?
 I'm not gonna go here.
 - Well, let's see--
 - This is, you want me to go here
 because this is what really sets people off.
 I'm onto you.
 - All right, well let's see.
 - Okay.
 - Let's see.
 - I'm ready.
 (dramatic music)
 Oh God.
 Oh God.
 Oh my God.
 - Yeah.
 - Antidope.
 - Yep, I told you, I told you, it'd be right back.
 - Can I hold?
 - I gave it a good shot.
 Only two more to go, two more to go.
 - It's immediately so much.
 - Yeah, and it doesn't stop.
 It doesn't stop.
 I think there's a little bit of a cumulative effect
 and it all hits the wall right here.
 - I need the eyes.
 - Yeah.
 So you said in your GQ Essentials piece
 that representation matters not only in the movies,
 but also in America's snack aisles.
 What are three Asian snacks you think should be
 more widely available in convenience
 and gas stations across the land and why?
 - Shrimp chips.
 Hello Panda.
 You know the Panda cookies with like a little bit
 of filling on the inside?
 - Yeah.
 - That hit so fast.
 - Yeah, yeah, and then just careful around your eyes,
 just careful around your eyes.
 (dramatic music)
 Then it just grows, it doesn't stop.
 It's a relentless sauce.
 - It's like getting your heart broken for the first time.
 There's no way to stop the hurt.
 - You think you'll never get out of it.
 - And then you just kinda stay with it?
 - Yeah, you just stick with it.
 - Find yourself a nice friend.
 - Exactly.
 - Who will support you through it.
 - And I'm right here with you.
 I'm right here with you.
 - One day you wake up and you're like,
 hey, doesn't hurt as much.
 But we're not there yet.
 - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 - You want some of this?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 (laughing)
 Antidote my ass.
 (dramatic music)
 - Andrew.
 - Andrew.
 - He's on set.
 - Andrew.
 (dramatic music)
 - What is this the antidote to?
 (burping)
 - Whoa.
 - I'm sorry, Sean.
 There's a lot of liquid in me right now.
 - No, no, make no apologies.
 - I apologize.
 - Make no apologies.
 - My behavior, no, this is not
 hell about the race, man.
 - You get a lot of space on this show.
 (dramatic music)
 - So this next one is Hellfire's Cranked.
 - That's the one with the crazy face.
 (laughing)
 I don't necessarily look at that and think
 that needs to be in me.
 - I should put this at my food, yeah.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Put this inside me, please.
 Okay.
 - Oh God.
 (sniffing)
 (dramatic music)
 Okay, are you okay?
 Fuck.
 (dramatic music)
 (crunching)
 - Pain.
 Pain.
 - But incredible perseverance on display.
 So recently you covered men's health
 and for good reason since I know
 that you've been tirelessly training
 at the CK gym that you recently built with your friends.
 (laughing)
 - Yes, yes, the CK, okay.
 Okay.
 - You have a very aggressive sort of high flying style
 of play.
 What is the key to a hard driven spike?
 - Ooh, very good question.
 Timing is more important than pure vertical.
 So, you know, if you have a good setter,
 he's setting at a really kind of like nice height
 where the ball is nice and floaty
 and you wanna basically watch for the apex.
 You wanna watch out for the apex of that set
 and once that ball starts to begin its downward trajectory,
 that's when you wanna launch yourself in the air
 so that you're making contact with the ball
 at the highest possible place.
 You wanna keep that ball in front of you.
 You don't wanna spike it too far over
 'cause that's not where you're gonna get your power from.
 You wanna hit it like right here
 and then you wanna give the wrist a nice little snap
 as you're making contact with the ball.
 So, apex, you go up, you're kind of targeting it
 with your non-dominant hand
 and then you kind of snake out, snap that wrist
 and then that's Spike's town, baby.
 - And then watch the bodies hit the floor.
 All right, Simu. - There you go.
 We've done it.
 We're here.
 It's almost over.
 Sean, come on.
 We've made it this far.
 Okay, how much do we put here?
 - Well, be careful 'cause I can already see
 that's got some liquid in it.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh yeah, that's too much
 already.
 - There you go.
 - Okay, a little dab.
 - Little dab. - Little dab, okay.
 - Little dab.
 That's good, that's good.
 - I'm doing this for you, Sean.
 - I'm honored.
 - I just hope you know.
 - I'm humbled.
 - Shall we cheers?
 - Cheers.
 - It's been fun.
 - Yeah.
 - That's a lie.
 (laughing)
 Let's go.
 (dramatic music)
 - Impressive, very impressive considering.
 - Whoa.
 - Okay.
 - We have to, it's the last one.
 What kind of example are we setting for the children?
 - Right, right, if we don't do this.
 (laughing)
 - Kids, try this at home.
 - This is a metaphor.
 Don't actually try it at home, it's a metaphor.
 It's a metaphor for perseverance.
 It's a metaphor for pursuing your dreams.
 It's a metaphor for staying strong in the face of adversity.
 And uh.
 - And you know what else?
 The good news is, Simu, that we have conquered
 the wings of death today.
 And the even better news is there's only one more question
 before we send you on your way
 with a to-go pint of ice cream.
 (laughing)
 A lot has been made about your totally coincidental
 but prognostic tweet about joining the Marvel Universe.
 If that helped to manifest your current reality,
 what is the next speak it into existence thing
 that is on your spice-soaked brain right now?
 Is it a dream to return LX4?
 - Oh my god.
 (laughing)
 - Maybe a debut album?
 - You guys.
 Now I have to explain it.
 I have to, I have to.
 In middle school, myself and three friends of mine
 started a boy band called LX4.
 Were we good?
 No.
 Did we ever go anywhere with our talents?
 Absolutely not.
 But boy, did we act like we were
 NSYNC incarnate.
 We were the Jonas Brothers that never were, unfortunately.
 We had one song called "For You"
 and I will not play it for you.
 - But you know what, Simu, the LX4 legacy,
 it lives on today in Hot Ones
 and with this amazing performance
 against the wings of death.
 And now, there's nothing left to do at long last
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - Oh, hell yeah.
 All right guys, look.
 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.
 You can stream it on Disney Plus.
 You can get the Blu-ray.
 You can get the HD Blu-ray.
 You can get the 8K special edition Blu-ray
 with the commentary and the deleted scenes.
 Follow your dreams.
 Persevere through adversity.
 And when life gives you the 10th wing with a dab,
 you take that dab and you finish the whole damn wing.
 All right?
 All right.
 Good talk.
 (applause)
 Thank you, Shang.
 - Woo!
 Good job.
 - Perfect.
 - Thank you, Simu.
 - Sure, free to go.
 Awesome, awesome.
 - I appreciate the deep cuts, man.
 - Oh yeah.
 We got you.
 We have to for Simu.
 - I literally was so spot,
 I didn't even mention to you,
 I am actually working on music right now.
 - Oh really?
 - It's too late.
 It's too late.
 It's done.
 (laughing)
 - There's always a bonus scene.
 There's always a bonus scene.
 - What's that for?
 - We're gonna pack up your sauces.
 - You're gonna get to take them all with you.
 (laughing)
 (burping)
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey everyone on Hot Ones fans,
