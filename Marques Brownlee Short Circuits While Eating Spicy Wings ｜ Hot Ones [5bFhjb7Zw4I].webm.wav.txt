 (dramatic music)
 - The ones that connect to a computer can be more immersive.
 I really like the, hold on.
 - Take your time, take your time.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching a Hot Ones reunion special
 brought to you by Diablo IV,
 the iconic action RPG series returning on June 6th.
 And we're once again joined in the hot seat
 by Marques Brownlee.
 For more than a decade, he's been YouTube's tech consigliere
 with his channel MKBHD.
 Proud to say I'm one of its 17 million subscribers.
 Check out his podcast Waveform
 and he has a brand new sneaker collaboration
 with Adams out as well, the model 251.
 Marques Brownlee, welcome back to the show.
 - Thank you again for having me.
 - You know, it's been almost five years to the day
 since our OG Hot Ones interview.
 It was back in season six of the show.
 How, if at all, has your relationship to hot sauce
 changed in that time?
 - I meant to talk to you about this.
 - Okay, great.
 - Before the show, I remember you asked,
 like, how are you with spicy food?
 And I didn't really have an answer.
 Since that show, I've become, I mean,
 I've had a lot of hot sauce in the fridge at work
 all over the place.
 I've become the spicy food guy somehow.
 So, it's changed in a good way.
 I think this show has introduced me
 to a world of spicy food.
 - We made you a Spiceman.
 - Yeah, yeah, which is awesome.
 - All right, you ready to get started?
 - I am.
 (dramatic music)
 Last time we did this, almost the bomb is the same.
 Everything else is different.
 So, I'm looking forward to re-experiencing it,
 but a little bit different.
 Also, I didn't eat lunch yet, so.
 - So, this is the perfect way to do it.
 (gentle music)
 So, one of your philosophies on making good videos
 that I really relate to is the idea
 that the gadget or product being reviewed
 should be the star of the show,
 which is really how I think about each new guest
 on an episode of Hot Ones.
 How has that insight steered the trajectory of MKBHD
 and your approach to being a host?
 - You know, it's funny, it actually helps.
 Anytime you talk to a creator or a YouTuber,
 you probably talk to a lot of them,
 where this concept of burnout comes up.
 - Yep.
 - And I just feel like the fact
 that I am not constantly trying to make,
 like if I was a vlogger, my own life would be the subject,
 and then you're trying to make your own life exciting
 for the video.
 So, it's nice that I am not the star of the show.
 I think over time, I had to realize that.
 And so, yeah, it's just a matter of finding
 cool new tech things happening, that's always happening,
 and I just got to point a camera at it,
 which is pretty sweet.
 And I feel like you also have this balancing act of like,
 you have to either make a guest more comfortable
 or let them fill the space.
 Like I remember watching the "Know the Grass Tights" episode
 where he just fills the room.
 - Yeah, right. - It's just what he does,
 and it's amazing.
 But you have this balancing act too.
 (crunching)
 (upbeat music)
 I like Verde hot sauces.
 Now I'm thinking about all the hot sauces
 we have in the studio.
 - And that you get to add more.
 - Are we gonna get some of these?
 - You're gonna get everything.
 - Yes, the studio crew's gonna be pumped about that.
 - So I know that you're inundated with requests
 to review products, and earlier this year,
 made a vow to say yes to every pitch email
 that hit your inbox.
 Can you give us one highlight and one low light
 from that 30-day experiment?
 - That was so much fun.
 I mean, my job at this point is not just reviewing tech,
 but filtering the inbox for what to say yes to.
 And I think part of that means a lot of stuff gets lost,
 that people don't even realize the absurd things
 that happen in the inbox.
 We're like, can you review this scooter
 that goes 60 miles an hour?
 Can you review this other thing?
 So I just said yes for a month.
 Got a bunch of weird stuff out of it.
 I think the highlight was that I was pleasantly surprised
 by some of the stuff, fully knowing that,
 before I even got it, I was like,
 I know I'm gonna hate this.
 And getting some of them,
 trying to think of a specific thing that we got,
 but some of the weird earbuds we got,
 which were cheap and kind of a knockoff,
 but also sounded pretty good, so it was surprising.
 Just gave me a new appreciation for,
 I think I'm gonna say yes to more things.
 Not to, this is gonna, the brands are gonna start
 pouring in. - Hey, you heard that,
 brands, green light to MKBHD's inbox.
 - Not everything, not everything.
 - What's the weirdest thing that got sent to you?
 - The weirdest, that's always a weird--
 - I mean-- - You got a coffin.
 - Yeah, the coffin might be the weirdest thing.
 And it's weird because we really got used to it.
 Like, we got the coffin a month into the series,
 and it's been sitting around in the studio,
 and we've fully gotten used to a coffin
 sitting in the middle of the studio for months,
 which is probably the weirdest thing.
 I do like lemon pepper.
 - So far, so good. - I like these.
 I'm gonna enjoy these while they're nicely spicy.
 - That's what's kinda nice about getting a second
 go-around on hot ones, you know?
 There's no like the fear and anxiety of the unknown,
 you know, you can really kinda like enjoy it.
 - I know where this is going.
 I know where this is going.
 I'm not gonna get overconfident.
 But like, first half, lunch.
 Second half, we'll see how it goes.
 - Battle, war. - Exactly.
 - What's your favorite car you've ever driven under $50,000?
 - Ooh, that's a tough price,
 'cause I was just talking about the EV6 GT,
 which I love, but it's $60,000.
 So my favorite car I've driven under 50.
 I think that might go to, that's a tough one.
 Polestar might be 55.
 - You can go 55.
 I'll give you a five grand leeway, yeah, yeah.
 - I really like the Polestar.
 And the Polestar is just like the sort of a midsize
 crossover, hatchback thing, super simple, made by Volvo.
 Not too flashy, but just like a solid, nice EV.
 And something you don't appreciate about cars
 until you get to use a bunch of them
 is their software across the board sucks.
 All of them, bad.
 So when they actually have good software
 and you just get to use it out the box
 and not worry about connecting your phone,
 that's kind of rare.
 - What's something people tend to over-index
 when they're shopping for a car,
 and then is there something that you think
 they don't think about enough?
 - Underappreciated is software,
 'cause it's either I'm connecting my phone via Bluetooth
 or they just go straight to CarPlay.
 And a lot of the ones that just go straight to CarPlay,
 you ignore the GPS built in, the radio built in,
 all those, and they're usually terrible,
 but if they're good, they could surprise you
 and maybe you might use that.
 So maybe that's under-indexed.
 And then probably over-indexed is performance.
 It's just fun.
 You don't actually need a fast car,
 but come on, it's fun, it's fun.
 It's a busy bottle.
 - Yeah, a lot going on.
 - Remember last time I reviewed the bottles?
 - Yeah, I remember that.
 - I'm sort of doing that again.
 - For a big time, yeah.
 So one of the staples of your channel
 has been the studio tours,
 and I know that you're working steadily
 to build out your ultimate content creation HQ.
 Is there a detail in the new studio
 that maybe people thought was ridiculous
 when you were conceiving it,
 but something that you're really proud of?
 - One thing I always point out,
 even though no one seems to care when I show it to them,
 is every room that we shoot video in
 also needs to sound good.
 You don't think about that until you're in a room
 that sounds bad.
 This room sounds good, and you look up,
 and you see the fiberglass,
 and you see the backdrop we have here,
 and all the things in the room contribute
 to it sounding good.
 So the first thing we did in our new spot,
 'cause it was an echo chamber,
 was put a ton of foam in the ceiling.
 It cost us too much,
 but to have people come up and glue foam
 to the entire ceiling,
 and then put our carpet down.
 And that probably would look ridiculous
 on an invoice sheet,
 and be like, "Why did you buy that much foam?"
 - Yeah, it sounds good.
 - But when you walk into that room,
 empty and clap, you would hear it,
 I'm not exaggerating,
 you would hear that clap for seven seconds.
 And now it just sounds like us talking in a room,
 which is a massive improvement.
 So, looks crazy to buy a bunch of foam, but it works.
 - What was the most jaw-dropping thing
 that you saw walking through the Mr. Beast campus?
 - That scale of operation is amazing.
 Jimmy's, has he not been on the show yet?
 - No, not yet, not yet.
 - Okay, well Jimmy, explain it to Sean for yourself, please.
 No, I mean, I'm the gear head,
 so I walked in the gear room,
 and there was just these shelves and shelves
 of cameras and batteries,
 'cause what they do is a little bit next level.
 We have a lot of cameras, obviously,
 but they'll shoot a challenge
 with like a hundred people doing something.
 All hundred people have a camera, and a battery,
 and an SD card, and a microphone,
 and suddenly there's just this wall of gear.
 - It's like an old school operator, you know,
 pulling this wire out of this thing.
 - There's a lot, yeah, exactly.
 And so, yeah, they have a lot,
 and that means there's a lot of chargers,
 a lot of memory card readers, a lot of all that stuff.
 - How would you grade the Hot Ones studio
 on a scale from content creator's paradise
 to total shithole?
 - All right, let's see here.
 Camera's pretty solid.
 I mean, this is the thing about,
 you walk into a studio,
 you never really know what to expect.
 Every time I walk into someone's studio,
 I'm surprised by something.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - This was nice.
 This sounds excellent.
 - Good sound.
 - I don't know if you appreciate how quiet it is in here.
 - It is, that's nice.
 - Like there's no HVAC sounds.
 You're in New York City, there's no helicopters.
 That's great.
 - We're in the void.
 - And then it gets dark back here,
 so you got this nice like focused lighting.
 I think I'm gonna give it a good grade.
 This is nice.
 This is a nice studio.
 - Well, we'll take that.
 We'll take that.
 - You've made it on YouTube.
 - Well, if Marques Brownlee says it,
 then you know it's the truth.
 Are you ready to move on here to the halfway point?
 - Calientes.
 - This is Los Calientes Rojo.
 - So good.
 - Still hitting.
 - Yeah.
 - Thus concludes the lunch portion.
 - Exactly.
 - Of today's program.
 - As suspected.
 - So my apologies,
 as I'm sure you get this all the time in your real life,
 but I have like some tech pet peeves
 that I kind of want to bounce off of you.
 And you might not even have a response to this.
 Maybe I just need you as like a shoulder to lean on,
 but here's my thing, all right?
 So in the decade plus since it was introduced,
 I feel like there has been zero improvement
 in airplane wifi, which for the record cost $39.95
 for a single cross country flight
 from New York to Los Angeles and vice versa.
 My question to you, maybe you know, maybe you don't,
 maybe you have a theory,
 but is the needle, the tech needle to thread
 on airplane wifi just so impossible
 or are we all getting robbed in the air?
 (laughing)
 - A little bit of both.
 It's definitely, I remember hearing from like my parents
 about how when you got on a long flight,
 you would just sit there and there was nothing to do.
 And so I can appreciate that at least there is wifi,
 but I'm with you,
 slow wifi is worse than no wifi at all.
 - And I feel like if we vote with our wallets
 and we start not using the airlines that have awful wifi,
 - There we go.
 - Maybe, maybe they'll be incentivized
 to do a little better.
 - The revolution starts today.
 (gentle music)
 - A little tart.
 Kind of like it.
 - Yeah.
 - It's not too, I mean, it might hit me in a second,
 but I kind of like it.
 - I'm not gonna lie on you.
 - Okay, that's fair.
 - Yeah, you know.
 - Yeah.
 - It's one of those that has like,
 you said tart upfront and I agree with you, right?
 - Yeah.
 - But then it's one of these that kind of builds.
 - Like a wave?
 - A little wave coming on.
 - Yeah, we've been, yeah.
 - Yeah, you know.
 Very pepper forward sauce right there.
 - Feel it.
 - Smokey, smokey, you know.
 So I mean this with all due respect,
 but your most impressive YouTube videos
 are the ultimate Frisbee highlights.
 Quick shout out to the New York Empire,
 your 2022 AUDL champions.
 - Thank you.
 - The pizza pie throw, all right?
 Is that actually practical?
 Is that useful or is that just for show offs?
 - You're talking about, I'm assuming,
 the sort of over the top weird one.
 - Yeah, the over the top, but you're not really gripping it.
 You know, you're just pizza pieing.
 - For the beach, you know, that's a fun one.
 In a game, a lot of people don't think about this,
 but you're throwing against someone
 who's right in front of you, called the mark.
 So the most useful throws are far out from your body
 or over the top of them.
 There's a lot of novelty fun throws on the beach
 that aren't that, so they wouldn't work in a game,
 but I appreciate the reference.
 - What's the most impressive trick shot
 you ever recall hitting off of the field?
 - Okay, so a long time ago,
 I did a YouTube collab with Brody Smith.
 - Yes, yes.
 - Who has done a ton of trick shots,
 really interesting ones.
 And he came out to our college campus,
 this is, I was in college at the time,
 and we just took a whole day to shoot trick shots.
 And first thing I thought in my head
 when shooting that video was like,
 how long does it really take this guy
 to hit these trick shots?
 And he's incredible at it.
 And the goal for the video was for me
 to also hit trick shots, and I was not incredible at it,
 so it took me a lot longer, but I hit some crazy,
 like sort of 40 yard diagonal off of a roof shot
 into a trash can that I felt pretty good about.
 I'll never be able to do that again,
 but that was my best trick shot.
 - And it was caught on video.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - You can't help saying that.
 (gentle music)
 - I kinda like the pepper, the jalapeno part of that one.
 - Yeah, which comes through.
 This one I feel like it's a little sharper now,
 but the other one was kind of like smoky.
 - You probably have the best description,
 like you know how people will describe wine
 'cause they taste like thousand?
 - Yeah, right, right, yeah, the hot sauce and malay.
 - You should have the shapes and the tones
 and textures of hot sauce, right?
 - Right, so like this one,
 a little bit more of a razor cut.
 A little bit more of a razor cut.
 - Sharp up front. - You know, yeah, yeah.
 Whereas this one, you know you're walking in a room
 full of smoke, you know?
 Smokey sauna is what we call this one.
 This one a little bit more razor blade,
 little cut, little cut action.
 - Feel that, interesting.
 I like that.
 - What's the YouTube rabbit hole or channel
 besides your own that you've binged the most
 in the last year?
 - Lifetime, probably Vsauce.
 - Yeah, legend.
 - I've watched like every Vsauce video and they're all long.
 So probably hours wise.
 I've also watched a lot of Schultz's podcasts.
 - You're on flagrant.
 - Yeah, yeah, those are long podcasts.
 I feel like yeah, podcasts probably the most hours.
 I do have my own podcast, which is like an hour long,
 but there are some like three hour podcasts
 that I watch on YouTube, so probably those.
 - There you go.
 Do you get into any like off-piece genres
 or like hyper specific YouTube genres?
 Like if you looked at my watch history,
 like basically it'd just be like suspect interrogation
 videos and then mini docs on like elderly people
 who are in romance scams.
 Like are you into anything weird?
 - YouTube has a way of finding you.
 Like your homepage is probably that specific.
 - Yeah, every time and I can't stop, I can't stop.
 - I have gotten into the exact same interrogation
 video rabbit hole probably that you have.
 - JCS baby.
 - There's a lot of them.
 - Mine right now is probably,
 so I've been watching a lot of car videos
 and there's a lot of car videos that are like 30 second
 intros made by the salesman in the dealership.
 - Interesting.
 - Which is a weird, I don't know how they get connected
 by the YouTube gods, but they just keep surfacing.
 Like Porsche of Englewood has a 30 second video
 about the 911 Carrera.
 You should watch it.
 You're not gonna buy it, just watch it.
 So that's one.
 - So basically like YouTube car classified ads?
 - Basically, yeah.
 I don't know how they connect these.
 Yeah, that was not even that weird, but they're.
 - Not as weird as me.
 - You've got some rabbit holes.
 - I gotta, I need an evaluation.
 All right, on the topic.
 - Here we are.
 - This next sauce.
 - Here we are.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 - My old friend, you know?
 - Yeah.
 (dramatic music)
 - Just as you remember it.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 Here we are, Sean.
 - Yep.
 - Yep.
 - Bring you back.
 - Yeah, did I ever tell you about last time?
 - No, tell me about last time.
 - Last time after the show,
 I had a Summer League Ultimate Frisbee right after.
 - What?
 - And that was the worst part of my day.
 It just sits with you, you know?
 - Yeah, and then, yeah.
 And the cramping that you can get
 with something like this, you know?
 I wouldn't even wanna be in a line when that hits
 and you were just like out on the field.
 - Yeah, running around.
 - Mm.
 Wow, that went way worse.
 - Then you remember it?
 - Yep.
 - I know, I know.
 You know, you get five years of distance from it
 and you're like, oh, well, how bad can it be?
 You know?
 - Rose colored glasses.
 - And then, yeah, and then you get face to face again.
 - Oh my God.
 - I know, I know, and it doesn't stop.
 - Do you have a Mount Rushmore of tech CEOs?
 - Not really.
 I think they're all, most of them,
 actually my favorites are the product people.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Because they get in the weeds
 of the actual quality of the product.
 But a lot of them are like steering a large boat
 with many oars.
 So I can respect the direction
 that they choose to steer the boat,
 but there's a lot of people helping those people out.
 - Yeah.
 And like the product person,
 like I've heard you make the comparison
 that like Steve Jobs was like a product guy, right?
 - Yeah.
 - But Tim Cook's a little bit different.
 - Yeah, he's the supply chain guy, which is cool.
 That's like a great, you know,
 that's how you become the CEO.
 It's by making them a lot of money, being very efficient.
 But I just like talking to product people
 'cause I care about the products.
 - You're a product guy.
 - Exactly.
 So yeah, I'm sure Tim's cool.
 (laughing)
 - If you were CEO of YouTube for a day,
 like what would be your first course of action?
 Like, is there a feature you'd bring back
 or one that you'd introduce?
 - I'm really good at looking backwards.
 - Yeah, me too.
 - I would, I would say,
 - Yeah, me too.
 - I'd bring back the dislike counter.
 - Yeah, I missed that.
 The thumbs up, thumbs down.
 - It's useful.
 - Yeah, I like that.
 - It's just a good way to show.
 - I like that, yeah.
 - You can't go back too far,
 but there was an old feature called video responses,
 where if someone made a video response to your video,
 you could approve it
 and it would show up right underneath your video.
 And it was a neat like networking feature where,
 you know, three cool people made a video response
 to your video, you could have them right below.
 That was cool, I'd bring that back too.
 - All right, Marques.
 - We're moving on already?
 Peculiar, okay.
 - It's a strange one.
 - It's the reddest one.
 - It is, it's the reddest hot sauce, yeah.
 It's a Rudolph's nose hot sauce.
 - Nothing can hurt me now.
 The bomb already got me.
 - Right.
 - I'm fine.
 - Yeah.
 - It's fine.
 - Just in times like these, right?
 - It is peculiar.
 - So I remember and appreciate the pro bono consulting work
 that you did for me when I was shopping for a camera.
 What's the most immersive VR experience you've ever had?
 'Cause now I'm in that market.
 - Recently, there's still like a,
 there's still two types of VR.
 There's the ones that are standalone
 and then there's the ones that are connected to a computer.
 The standalone ones are kind of limited
 by the fact that they need a battery
 and they need to be lightweight.
 The ones that connect to a computer can be more immersive.
 I really liked the, hold on.
 - Take your time, take your time.
 - I really liked the PlayStation, the PSVR 2.
 If you've tried that one.
 It's really, it's good.
 It's immersive.
 It's really virtual.
 - All right, Marques, as we've established,
 you're well versed in the tradition of hot ones.
 So you're probably wondering to yourself right now,
 where is the last app?
 Where is the last app?
 Well, I regret to inform you that we are now face to face
 with a special edition Diablo 4 sauce.
 This one right here, Lilith's Hatred.
 - Okay, sure.
 - In the game, she's the demonic mother of humanity
 and co-creator of Sanctuary, where Diablo 4 takes place.
 She's also known as the Daughter of Hatred
 and is the big bad of Diablo 4.
 So it's safe to say this sauce will be hell,
 but I think for tradition's sake,
 we should put a little on the last wing.
 - I feel like, all right, I feel real.
 All right, there we go.
 - So here we go.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.
 - So Diablo 4, all about letting you play your way
 from customizing your character
 to exploring a totally open world.
 Here on Hot Ones though, there's only one way to end.
 And it's not easy.
 - All right.
 - Cheers, Marques. - Cheers.
 - And there we go.
 I know, I know.
 - Yep.
 - I know.
 - Yeah.
 - Okay, Marques Brownlee, to close things out,
 I love the way that you, Andrew, and David
 break up the podcast with these trivia mini games, all right?
 But you've never had to take on these kinds of questions
 with your brain marinating in hot sauce.
 So what I have here is a tech quiz for you,
 a tech pop quiz.
 Multiple choice, you get two out of three of these right,
 I'll be blown away, especially under these conditions.
 All right, are you ready?
 - Okay.
 - Question number one.
 What was the first computer virus
 to cause a massive global epidemic discovered in 1988?
 Was it I Love You, Melissa Virus, Morris Worm, or My Doom?
 - Dang.
 I'm really glad it's multiple choice.
 That's tough.
 Is it I Love You?
 - It is Morris Worm.
 Morris Worm, one down.
 We got two more, we got two more, we got two more.
 - It's gotta be milk.
 - What was the name of the first electronic
 general purpose computer completed in 1945?
 Univac One, IBM 701, ENIAC, Colossus.
 - I just want you to know, I have no idea.
 - Just take a swing, baby.
 - There's no way I would know anything about,
 that's why I did Retro Tech.
 I don't know anything about pre-2000 tech.
 Give me those one more time.
 - Ready? - Yeah.
 - Univac One, IBM 701, ENIAC, Colossus.
 - Univac One?
 - It was ENIAC, it was ENIAC.
 One more for you, one more for you.
 - Not going well.
 - And it's super easy.
 What is the name of the principle stating
 that it is impossible to perfectly replicate
 both the position and momentum
 of a quantum particle simultaneously?
 Is that Schrodinger's Uncertainty Principle,
 Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,
 Planck's Uncertainty Principle,
 or Dirac's Uncertainty Principle?
 - Univac One.
 - Univac One.
 - Uncertainty Principle.
 I wanna get one of these right.
 So this is, I gotta think about this one.
 One more time.
 - Sure, are you ready?
 - Yes, yes, I'm listening carefully.
 - What is the name of the principle stating
 that it is impossible to perfectly replicate
 both the position and momentum
 of a quantum particle simultaneously?
 - Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
 - Without even taking on the multiple choice,
 the answer is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
 - Dang, look at you, Marques Brownlee,
 for the second time taking on the wings of death
 and living to tell the tale.
 Now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 - I'm just, I'm still making tech YouTube videos.
 I'm doing the same thing I was doing five years ago,
 just like you.
 - I'll see you in another five years.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 This is real.
 I'm glad that the sauces are still pretty fire.
 Catch me on YouTube, I guess.
 (clapping)
 - Good job.
 - I feel like it's just the bomb.
 (laughing)
 - But no more, you don't have any ultimate Frisbee practice.
 - No, not today.
 I didn't make the same mistake twice.
 (soft music)
