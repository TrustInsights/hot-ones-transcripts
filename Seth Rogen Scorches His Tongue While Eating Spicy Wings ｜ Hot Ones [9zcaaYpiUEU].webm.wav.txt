 - Oh!
 - And it grows, and it grows, and it grows.
 - Woo!
 That one is a lot.
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 From First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we open up season 17 with Seth Rogen.
 He's an actor and filmmaker who's been a leading
 and very busy comedic presence in Hollywood
 for damn near 20 years.
 He has a pair of highly anticipated projects on the way,
 including the Hulu limited series Pam and Tommy,
 which is set to release on February 2nd,
 as well as The Boys Presents Diabolical,
 an animated anthology series set in the universe
 of the Emmy nominated hit series The Boys,
 premiering exclusively on Prime Video March 4th.
 Seth Rogen, welcome back to the show.
 - Thanks for having me.
 - And then this is now your third time doing Hot Ones.
 - It is.
 - It's rarefied air on this show.
 What's going through your head as you prepare to dig in?
 - Something you said, I think I was with other people
 both other times.
 - Charlize and Dom.
 - And I think the first time I'm doing 10.
 So eating 10 Hot Wings for me is not generally
 like a big deal.
 So I guess we'll see how it goes.
 I'm excited.
 I'm looking forward to it.
 (dramatic music)
 - Okay.
 Just go?
 - Just go.
 - It's good.
 Easy.
 (laughing)
 - So to open things up with Pam and Tommy,
 a series that documents the Pamela Anderson,
 Tommy Lee Hollywood video that was famously stolen
 by a disgruntled contractor and then leaked to the internet.
 How do you quantify the significance
 of the Pam and Tommy sex tape?
 Like could a case be made that an internet show like this
 might not even exist if not for the tectonic shift
 that happened after that video napalmed the internet?
 - Um, yeah, I think there's a line that could be drawn
 between like just watching things on the internet
 and that tape.
 It's one of the first things that like was consumed
 in mass online in video form.
 The ingenuity that went into people trying to disseminate
 that tape, even though it was very wrong of them,
 is something that we all ultimately live in the shadow of.
 My wife isn't good with hot food,
 so I gauge everything of like,
 would I tell my wife this is too hot to eat?
 And I don't think.
 I think she can handle that. - Wing one just okay?
 - Yeah, totally fine.
 - Well, are you ready to move on to the second one?
 It's actually from Canada.
 - Ooh. - Special for you, Seth.
 - Cedar smoked garlic hot sauce.
 If you may, you see there.
 (laughing)
 - I mean, actually kind of a spicy number two.
 - You must be familiar with those.
 (laughing)
 That is a spicy number two though.
 - It is, I told you. - All jokes aside.
 - I told you, all jokes.
 (laughing)
 So as you mentioned up top,
 you have the boys diabolical coming soon to Prime Video.
 As someone who was once described by GQ
 as the patron saint of disturbing comics,
 what sorts of things do you look for
 in a comic book source material that make you think
 this would make a good TV show or movie?
 - Something like "The Boys" was just like,
 it was obvious to us, you know?
 And it's a funny journey with the comic
 because like me and Evan, my partner,
 we're big fans of Garth Ennis who wrote the comic.
 He wrote "Preacher" as well.
 And we bought the first issue right when it came out.
 I remember we were like, oh my God,
 this would be like such a great movie.
 Like kind of regular people fighting superheroes, you know?
 And we brought it to Sony and Neil Moritz, the producer.
 And they were like, yeah,
 this would make an incredible movie.
 We'll buy the rights to it.
 And then they did.
 And then they did not hire us to write it
 or produce it in any way, shape or form.
 They hired other people to do that.
 And after like a decade of those people
 just like fucking it up in some way, shape or form,
 it like came back to us basically.
 And then we turned it into the TV show.
 (laughs)
 I think people love superhero stuff
 and Marvel's obviously very popular
 and makes great films and TV shows,
 but there are certain things they just can't do.
 Like it would simply be too damaging to their brand
 to have like a character kill someone with a 10 foot dick.
 So as long as they're not doing that,
 it leaves a great opportunity for us to do that.
 (laughs)
 - Calabria.
 - Ooh, continental.
 - So you've appeared on the burger show multiple times.
 - I have.
 - I know that you're a connoisseur
 when it comes to the religion of burger,
 cheese, meat and bun.
 Can you explain your theory
 that thick patties are for dickheads?
 - I just, you know, and I said that,
 I'd say before the like smash burger craze kind of took over,
 which was a validating thing to happen
 in the wake of that statement.
 But yeah, I just, ooh, it went into my throat.
 I just didn't love, I didn't so love these thick patties
 that started sweeping the nation.
 And I love like a crispy burger, like a thin crispy burger.
 And I would also rather eat more small burgers
 than one big burger.
 But my being on that show led me
 to judge a hamburger competition
 where over the course of one night,
 I ate like 50 hamburgers
 for the LA Food and Wine Festival, I think it was.
 And it was truly like one of the greatest days
 of my entire life.
 It was wonderful.
 - Well, you're welcome for that.
 You're welcome.
 - Yes. (laughs)
 A little spicy.
 Ooh, I caught the pepper.
 I think I caught the pepper. (laughs)
 I can see from your face,
 you're catching the pepper a little bit too.
 - Lighten up over here.
 - Yeah, ooh, catching the pepper.
 - So your preference for making films
 for a low enough budget that nobody bothers to come
 and check in on what's going on,
 it really resonated with us here at this show
 'cause that's more or less the history of Hot Ones.
 Why is 25 to $35 million for you
 the ideal amount of money to make a movie?
 - I mean, that's what it's been.
 And I'd say that is shifting.
 Like I'd say over the last few years have greatly,
 they've made it much harder, especially for comedies.
 We've been lucky in that we've made a few
 over the last few years,
 but traditionally that has been a number
 that makes us a studio film,
 but never one of their bigger movies.
 And they're always off making like,
 you know, as we're making blockers,
 they're making like Fast and Furious 8.
 So it's like, they're not worried about us
 'cause like Vin Diesel won't come out of his dressing room
 and it's costing them like $10 million a day
 or some shit like that.
 So like our whole movie is like less than Vin Diesel wastes
 on the average, like afternoon on a Fast and Furious film.
 And so as a result of that,
 they generally leave us alone.
 - In your experience of pitching scripts,
 what have you found to be the most enticing
 or persuasive selling points to make to a studio?
 - To a studio, if it's like easy.
 A movie like Neighbors, like that sold very easily.
 It's like, oh, like we're a couple with a new baby.
 We miss partying.
 We live next to a fraternity house.
 Like, you know, you don't have to be a genius
 to see how that would like be a broad appeal.
 You know what I mean?
 But even something like Sausage Party,
 like no one wanted to make, you know?
 And Superbad no one wanted to take part in.
 Pineapple Express no one wanted to make.
 So like, what's nice is now that we,
 it's like now we can make like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
 movie, but we're also trying to make like insane things
 that no one wants to touch.
 And it's nice that we can kind of work
 in both worlds a little bit, you know?
 (soft music)
 - Okay. This is your own Hot One sauce.
 - Yeah.
 - Did you work on, did you formulate this a little bit?
 - Not, I wasn't like in a bathtub,
 mixing it up or anything.
 - Then I don't want to eat it.
 (laughing)
 Bathtub hot sauce.
 - But if you don't like it, Seth, let me know.
 - You will take it personally?
 - Uh-uh.
 Very good.
 I'm not catching the pepper in the same way
 on this one as I was the previous one.
 - I feel like this lineup, it kind of shifts.
 - It's kind of a good take.
 I don't know what to expect.
 It's bobbing and weaving a little bit.
 This one's less hot than the previous one.
 - Right.
 - I assume a little point where it's all just like insanity
 and excruciating pain, so it won't matter anymore.
 - That's coming up. That's coming up.
 But in the meantime, Seth, we have a recurring segment
 on our show called Explain That Gram,
 where we do a deep dive on our guest's Instagram,
 pull interesting pictures that need more context.
 So we'll pull up the picture over here on the monitor.
 - Yeah.
 - You just tell us the bigger story.
 How big a thrill was it for you to share a performance
 of young, wild, and free with Snoop Dogg,
 Hilarity for Charity?
 - Yeah, this was Hilarity for Charity,
 which is an Alzheimer's organization
 that me and my wife and some friends founded.
 And one year, Snoop Dogg was the headliner.
 And he auctioned off a blunt for $10,000,
 which was, I would say, probably not a lot
 of Alzheimer's organizations can make that claim.
 But we can.
 It was amazing.
 - You, on a pretty regular basis,
 find yourself in a situation where you smoke weed
 with Snoop Dogg, and that is, as far as life,
 signs your life isn't going terribly go, that's a good one.
 - That's up there.
 All right, up next, of all your vintage ashtrays
 that you own, is there one that you describe as a holy grail?
 - This one is a pretty rare one,
 and a pretty hard to find one.
 'Cause I think they're hand-painted Louis Vuitton
 and hand-glazed ceramic Louis Vuitton ashtrays.
 There's not a ton of them.
 I haven't seen a lot of them.
 So that one is pretty nice.
 I think it's from the '50s or '60s or something like that.
 Well, what I actually got really fascinated by
 was what companies used to make ashtrays.
 So I own a lot of Disney ashtrays,
 'cause I think it's funny that Disney used to make ashtrays.
 The government made ashtrays.
 I own a bunch of NASA ashtrays,
 'cause NASA made ashtrays.
 I own some from the Department of Defense,
 things like that.
 The FBI, they had ashtray.
 If you went to the FBI in the '70s,
 there was ashtrays there, you know?
 And their own branded ashtrays.
 So I became fascinated.
 I have a post-serial ashtray, like a 7-Up ashtray.
 I just kind of became fascinated by who made ashtrays
 at various points in their history.
 So yeah, that was a weird rabbit hole I've been going down.
 Cocoa Ghost.
 - Okay.
 (dramatic music)
 How often do you rub your eyes or something like that?
 - Well, I've done it enough
 to where now I'm paranoid about it.
 - I felt that one in my ears.
 (laughing)
 I could hear it.
 - But thanks for pointing that out,
 'cause usually I'm just all over our guests
 to be like, careful around the eyes,
 careful around the eyes.
 - My friend was saying he was doing
 the Hot Wings Challenge on New Year's,
 and he got some in his pee hole.
 - Ooh!
 - That's occupational hazard.
 (laughing)
 It happens.
 Any sort of cross-pollination hot sauce problem
 that you can have, I've had.
 - I'm so sorry.
 (laughing)
 I'm so sorry.
 - So you've added a wrinkle into the definition of pothead
 by getting into ceramics recently,
 comparing it to a meditative hobby like yoga,
 except that you get a vase at the end
 of your Bikram session.
 Do you have a go-to glaze recipe?
 - I do have a go-to glaze recipe
 that I've kind of formulated on my own.
 So I'm not that it would make,
 (laughing)
 but it includes magnesium carbonate
 as one of the main ingredients,
 and that's what causes the glazes to glop up
 like my glazes do, and they have these,
 they're very bumpy and textural.
 And you get better at it, which is nice,
 'cause I can't necessarily say that
 about everything else I do in life.
 - Yeah, except for karate.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 - When you were the back of the class
 and then to the top, you know?
 - Just don't quit.
 - That's the theme, that's the theme, Seth.
 - Just don't quit.
 And speaking of, speaking of, not quitting,
 forging ahead. - Jacqueline Hyde.
 - 13 Angry Scorpion, Jacqueline Hyde.
 - Freakishly hot.
 (dramatic music)
 Ooh.
 - Ooh.
 But glowing back in.
 - I mean, you gotta finish them, right?
 - Can't stop, won't stop.
 My head is starting to sweat.
 (laughing)
 - Oh yeah, I can see it coming through.
 - Out of somewhere weird.
 Like, I can't definitely say sweat
 has ever come from that part.
 Or it might be a tear.
 (laughing)
 I don't know if it's sweat or a tear.
 Liquid is coming from my head,
 and I'm afraid to wipe it away 'cause of my hands.
 (laughing)
 - Is it true that the roller coaster montage
 in "Knocked Up" was one of the most difficult to shoot
 because Jay Baershall has a paranoia,
 a fear of roller coasters?
 Also, they make you puke?
 - Yes.
 That day was fucked up.
 And I think it's in the movie.
 Jay's having a full-on panic attack.
 - Yeah, yeah, he's not acting.
 - No, he's not acting.
 He's like, "Get me out, get me out of this fucking thing."
 And then the rest of us had to ride it
 like fucking 10 more times or some shit like that,
 and we're doing the fucking falling thing.
 Jay was having a nervous breakdown.
 Jason was on oxygen.
 I was half passed out, half vomiting,
 on Dravamine all day.
 So yeah.
 - Is it true that one of the seminal scenes of "50/50"
 where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Adam,
 is shaving his head, that that was improvised?
 You guys were improvising the characters
 as the cameras were still rolling?
 - Yes.
 That was high-stakes improv.
 Yeah, I'd say in the pantheon of head-shaving scenes.
 G.I. Jane, Empire Records, "50/50."
 - Put it on the mouth-rush now.
 - Yeah. (coughs)
 Oh, no.
 (laughing)
 My own saliva just betrayed me.
 (laughing)
 (dramatic music)
 It reminds me of once I had to film in a blizzard
 and my mouth, or like mouth, froze and we couldn't talk.
 That's how it feels right now.
 But the opposite, yeah.
 Okay.
 - But regaling me with great stories from memory.
 - I'm trying to take my mind off it.
 (dramatic music)
 - Yeah.
 (sighs)
 - That one, that's a lot.
 - Like when I was telling you it never gets any easier.
 There's nothing.
 - This is the kind of thing that you like,
 this morning when you wake up, you're just like,
 "I know at some point today this is gonna happen to me."
 It's a fun job, you like it?
 - Except for this part.
 - Yeah.
 - They all have their pitfalls.
 And it grows, and it grows, and it grows.
 (dramatic music)
 - That one is a lot.
 I'm like sweating and I'm afraid to take off my glasses.
 'Cause I'm like afraid even of like the proximity.
 (laughing)
 My head to my head, my head to my head.
 - I can't talk.
 - So, I know that you're a student of comedy film
 and you mark one of your favorites as the last detail.
 The 1973 Hal Ashby directed film starring Jack Nicholson.
 What did you mean by, "It's always about the joke,
 it's never about the camera moves?"
 - Uh-huh.
 Ooh.
 I think, I think for comedy,
 and it's something I grapple with a lot, is that like,
 you know, I think as a filmmaker, when you make things,
 your instinct is to make them look fancy.
 And I think the conundrum is at times for comedy,
 the less fancy it looks, the funnier it is.
 And the more simple it is, the funnier it is.
 That was a close call that I just took.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - I'm watching it, it's really dangerous.
 - I got you Seth, I got you.
 - And so, "South Park" should never be able to be as funny
 as like a Pixar movie because it doesn't look as good.
 But that's not how it is.
 Like, a thing doesn't need to look good to be very funny.
 And at times, honestly, like the worst,
 by some conventional standards,
 a thing looks the funnier it is.
 I'm dying, my lips are burning.
 (laughing)
 - Me too, me too.
 - My lips are like a little chap all day today.
 And I was like, oh no, that's gonna be such a bummer later.
 - I feel like I have like an inch of standing water
 in my left eye.
 - But you can't wipe it.
 (laughing)
 - This next one is the Pucker Butt.
 - Great.
 That's what you're secretly thinking
 whenever you're eating this stuff,
 is how will this make my ass feel?
 And the Pucker Butt brand was--
 - They spelled it right out for you.
 - Bold enough to be like, we'll fucking tell ya.
 It'll make your asshole really hurt.
 (laughing)
 - That was a funny noise.
 You just prepare yourself, okay.
 - Very hot.
 But after the last one--
 - Not as, still very hot though.
 - This one's making my gums hurt.
 It keeps running new parts of my mouth to make hurt.
 I keep being like, that's the whole mouth, but no.
 - Checking all the boxes.
 - Checking all the boxes.
 - So one of your first big breaks
 was a writing job on the Ali G Show,
 and recently that you tweeted
 that Sacha Baron Cohen is the only person I know
 who truly risks his life for his art.
 During your time on the show,
 do you ever recall an instance of being worried
 about his wellbeing during a shoot?
 - Yes.
 Lots of times.
 We went to spring break,
 kinda messing with really drunk agro frat guys.
 There was a point where Sacha had to like, run away.
 Oh no, I keep like, snorting, forgetting
 that I'm just like sitting like at a concentrated rocket
 of hot sauce saliva in the back of my mouth.
 So yeah, he would go and shoot all day,
 and then come back and like show us the footage basically.
 I remember that was one where like,
 he was almost getting killed and he ran away,
 but he was wearing his mic,
 and so you could still hear him,
 and he stayed in character the whole time.
 And he was Bruno, and the whole time he's like,
 they're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill me.
 And he's like hiding in a shop, he's like sorry.
 And you hear him like talking to the shop owner,
 like asking if he could hide,
 and like, and he never broke character the entire time,
 but he like was legitimately running out of fear
 for his wellbeing.
 - Speaking of fear.
 It's time for the final sauce.
 (sighs)
 And going into sauce 10,
 we'll be joined by a very special guest.
 - Evan.
 (laughs)
 Does he have his own wing?
 - Way to blow the surprise.
 - Sorry, you can edit it out.
 You control this footage.
 - All right, for wing 10, we have a very special guest,
 screenwriter, producer, director, Evan Goldberg.
 You guys have been collaborators
 since you were literally kids,
 and now look at us, tag teaming the last dab together.
 - Should we eat off the same wing?
 (laughs)
 - Your choice, your choice.
 - We each have our own, let's stick to it.
 - But before that, it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last one.
 You don't have to.
 - My head feels crazy.
 - Yeah.
 - Do you need my help opening that?
 (laughs)
 - I truly feel insane.
 (laughs)
 I feel nuts.
 (laughs)
 - You look normaller than you think you might.
 - Thank God.
 (laughs)
 My mouth is burning.
 I'm literally thinking like,
 do I have any other things I'm supposed to do today?
 'Cause I don't think I can do them.
 (laughs)
 - We're writing a book together.
 - Oh yeah.
 (laughs)
 - Nothing better to prime your mind.
 - It'll do exactly, it'll shake the ideas loose over here.
 Cheers guys.
 - Cheers.
 (soft music)
 - Normally when I see people on this,
 they say like, I don't feel anything at first.
 It instantly hurts.
 - Yeah.
 Well, Evan, you're not here, you know, eating the wing.
 You know, you're just on a straight vertical ramp up
 right now.
 - Feels like I am.
 (laughs)
 Oh, it hurts my lips real bad.
 - The lip pain is by far the worst part.
 I'm sweating so much my glasses are like sliding
 down my head.
 - But so careful.
 - Yeah, exactly.
 - Look over there, Seth.
 - I got it, I got it.
 - It is beautiful to watch, a sight to behold.
 - This tastes great.
 I am into this.
 - I need to soak my lips in the milk.
 - I need to eat more of this.
 - Evan, we got a bottle for you to go.
 We've got a bottle for you to go.
 - This was a great, this was a great quick visit.
 I'm so happy right now.
 - And congratulations to the both of you
 conquering the wings of death today.
 Maybe this is a surprise to Seth, but at this point,
 I'm gonna turn the show over to Evan to ask Seth
 a question that only a close childhood friend could know.
 - Only me.
 - An intimate wingtent conclusion
 to the season 17 premiere of Hot Ones.
 - Okay.
 - Here's what I got.
 - Okay.
 - Seth has done many brave things on camera, off camera.
 You've been a brave partner in our business endeavors.
 - That's nice.
 - But there was a time in 10th grade when you did
 one of the least brave things I've ever seen someone do.
 - Oh no.
 - It was in Tawassin.
 Do you have any recollection of perhaps
 the moment I'm referring to?
 - I do remember this.
 - And it was a cowardly maneuver.
 (laughing)
 And it was something that if you were my friend,
 I would always look at me a little differently after this.
 - It took like a decade, but I'm over it.
 - We were Tawassin.
 Let's start with Tawassin.
 - That's the name of a town.
 - Tawassin's a place that's like 40 minutes
 outside of Vancouver.
 Oh my God.
 - It's like working its way along my lips
 and spreading on the inside of my mouth.
 - And they had a giant paintball facility,
 like a huge outdoor paintball facility.
 And we all went paintballing there.
 And these guys showed up
 that were like professional paintball guys.
 We're like 15 years old.
 And they're fucking loaded with paintball bullets
 and they have like automatic paintball guns.
 We have like the pump action, cheap, shitty paintball guns.
 - We didn't know like what their guns could do.
 - No, and they right away from my memory,
 just like fucking unload like a torrent of like automatic.
 - Like a chain gun kind of thing.
 - And I run off into the woods
 as literally all my friends get annihilated.
 - As these men, like I got shot 25 times in the back.
 Then you must've been alone in the woods getting guns in.
 - For my memory, I was like,
 "We did it guys, we got away."
 I looked back and I was all alone.
 And I was like, "Oh no."
 - And like we all got hurt.
 Like I was covered in welts.
 - Oh yeah, they were like bleeding.
 And then I came back and everyone was really pissed at me.
 They were like, "What did you, like you fucking cowards.
 "We were upfront and you bailed on all of us."
 - It's been uphill since then.
 - I had to earn back their trust.
 - Well, you know what, that's good to know.
 And Evan, I hope that this was cathartic for you
 to hear that story from Seth.
 - I mean, just like this heat is heating my gum line.
 - It is, it feels like it worked into my teeth.
 - But you know what, you made it through Seth.
 Evan, you made it through.
 You reached the finish line,
 conquered the wings of death.
 Now for the third time, hang that Rogan jersey
 in the rafters and now there's nothing left to do.
 But we're all at the red carpet for you, Seth.
 This camera, this camera, this camera.
 Let the people know what you have going on in your life.
 We have "The Boys Presents Diabolical,"
 which is an animated anthology series
 in the universe as the boys.
 I don't know if you ever heard of the Animatrix.
 That was the series of short animated films
 they released when the Matrix films came out.
 Well, we ripped off that.
 - The only little twist we have is there's like
 eight different creative entities behind each of them
 and we do one and we have Justin Roiland doing one
 and Awkwafina, so it's like a real wild mixed bag
 and the animation's really different every time.
 - Yeah, they're all really insane and wonderful.
 And February 2nd, Pam and Tommy comes to Hulu.
 - My brain is not, my brain has been infiltrated by peppers.
 (laughing)
 We did it.
 - Great job.
 - My body, it sounds like your system into shock a little bit.
 - Yeah, no, sometimes I do straight up like walk out of here
 like not feeling my feet with like some lightheaded action.
 - Have you talked to a doctor about the long-term possible
 ramifications of continued--
 - You know what's funny about that is--
 - No.
 (laughing)
 You know what's funny is I'm afraid to.
 (laughing)
