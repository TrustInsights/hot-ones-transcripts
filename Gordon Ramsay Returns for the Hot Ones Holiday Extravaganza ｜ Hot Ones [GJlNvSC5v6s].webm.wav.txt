 (typing)
 - Is that not hot for you?
 - Yeah, it is hot, it is hot,
 but I think I'm distracted by what's going on.
 Whoa!
 (laughing)
 (upbeat music)
 (upbeat music)
 - Hey, what's going on and happy holidays, Hot Ones fans.
 This is Sean Evans coming at you
 from the cozy Hot Ones Cabin,
 which may or may not be located
 in the middle of an office block in Midtown Manhattan,
 and we're gathered for the first ever
 Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza,
 a spicy December treat,
 and it's all for a good cause
 as we hopefully help our charity partner, Common Threads,
 reach their fundraising goals
 so they can continue to provide nutrition
 and cooking classes for families in need
 all across the country.
 There's some more information,
 a donate button just to the side of this video,
 waiting to be smashed.
 What is the Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza?
 Well, you know what?
 I'm happy that you asked.
 We'll have our first ever taste test of Hot Ones Jr.,
 the only sauce that, to our knowledge,
 has been made specifically for kids.
 We have festive dishes made by your first We Feast favorites,
 Nicole Russell, Alvin Kylon, George Motes,
 as well as the inaugural Hot Ones Awards
 hosted by poor man's Ricky Gervais, camera guy Bill,
 and I know that you clocked it in the cold open.
 You saw the thumbnail and it had a Pavlovian pull
 for anyone whose blood runs spicy,
 and that is the long-awaited return of Gordon Ramsay.
 And let me tell you something,
 if you thought the sequel couldn't top the original,
 Santa has got a whole new bag of tricks,
 so all I can say is stay tuned.
 And all I ask in return,
 as a humble Chicken Wing talk show host,
 is that if you're able,
 please consider a donation to Common Threads,
 whether it's a dollar, five dollars, $500,
 every little bit counts to help kids
 in under-resourced communities make affordable, nutritious,
 and appealing food choices wherever they live,
 work, learn, and play.
 Please consider if you're able,
 it would mean the world to me
 and to the families who are supported by Common Threads.
 And now let's kick this thing off
 the only way we know how.
 With the kids who helped inspire this event
 in the first place,
 it is the super official Hot Ones Junior Taste Test
 with the young Spice Lords of Common Threads.
 - Welcome to Hot Ones Junior!
 (laughing)
 - Kaya, take one, mark.
 - Hi, my name is Kaya, I'm 12 and I'm from Brooklyn.
 - My name is Owen, I'm 12 years old and I'm from Brooklyn.
 - My name's Liv, I am 12 years old
 and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
 - My name is Ethan, I'm 12 years old and I'm from Brooklyn.
 - You told me you took a couple of virtual classes
 with Common Threads,
 can you tell me what you learned in those classes?
 - Like different diets and how to get the protein
 and the starch and all that good stuff.
 - Basically the nutrition facts of Cheerios
 and different things like that,
 about different things that we can make at home.
 - Making like healthy snacks so you can eat after school
 and we also learned about the serving size that you need.
 - Have you ever had hot sauce before?
 - I have, I have had hot sauce before.
 - And do you like it?
 - No.
 - Usually when I have fries,
 I put ketchup and hot sauce on my fries.
 - I'm not super into hot sauce, so not really.
 - I've had spicy food but I don't eat it regularly,
 at least not as regularly as my brother.
 - What if I told you that we created a hot sauce
 just for kids?
 - That's cool, I actually don't believe that though.
 Oh, it's green, why is it green?
 - It's really cool.
 - How do I hear a sauce?
 - It kinda looks like go-gurt.
 You know those like tubes of go-gurt
 where it has the, not the animals.
 - The green, hot sauce by Heatent.
 I have no clue how to pronounce this word.
 Sadly, I've never heard of it in my life.
 - Hot Ones Junior, it says Junior.
 I like that, I like that.
 - So it has apple in it?
 - No sugar added.
 - Green apple, apple juice, sweet onion.
 - Lime juice, baby spinach, apple cider vinegar.
 - Jalapeno peppers, banana.
 - Kosher salt, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil.
 It actually sounds pretty good.
 - You know something's good
 when you can like recognize all the ingredients.
 - There was like literally only one spicy ingredient,
 so I liked that.
 - I don't really like onions that much
 and apple cider vinegar, but yeah.
 - It smells kind of sweet and spicy actually.
 - I do smell a lot of green apples.
 - It's almost like I can smell each ingredient almost.
 - So, you ready to taste it?
 - Yeah.
 - All right, let's bring it in.
 - Thank you.
 - Okay, so it's too spicy.
 - Yeah.
 - Let's bite into it.
 - Hmm.
 - Hmm, this is really good.
 - I'm on the board.
 - I think I'm a bit ready to try some more,
 on a lot more.
 Excuse me.
 It's a tiny bit sweet, but mostly spicy,
 and it's pretty good.
 - My tongue is stinging a little bit.
 - I can feel the spice, but it's like, it's really nice.
 - But you can't really taste as much of the spice,
 which is pretty good for those
 who may not like as much spice.
 - And what about the apple cider vinegar?
 - I actually didn't taste that.
 I forgot that was in the ingredients list, honestly.
 - You get a little dash of spice,
 and then you get a little bit of childhood memories.
 - It tastes really, really good,
 which I like in a, like a, excuse me.
 - Tastes pretty good.
 It tastes like a hot sauce, but it's still healthy for you.
 It's good.
 You'll be missing out if you don't.
 - Oh!
 (crew laughing)
 (beep)
 - Thanks for watching.
 - Thanks for supporting Common Threads.
 - Happy holidays, everyone.
 - Back to you, Sean.
 - Wow.
 Which one of those kids do you think has taken my job
 in 10 years?
 Because my money is on Ethan.
 And if you'd like to put your money on Ethan as well,
 consider taking a stroll over that donate button
 and contributing to Common Threads.
 And of course, if you want to get your hands
 on Hot Ones Jr., you know the drill.
 Heatness.com, heatness.com to order.
 And you know, the goal of Common Threads,
 it's not only to just provide meals,
 it's also to provide cooking instructions
 so that those kids can take that education
 back to their families, back to their communities,
 and make those choices, those healthy lifestyle choices,
 in the long term.
 So with that in mind, we challenged the host
 of the Burger Show, Pizza Wars, and Burger Scholar sessions
 to make us a festive dish that's fit for the holidays.
 Alvin, take it away.
 - Thanks, Sean.
 And happy holidays to everybody who's watching.
 First, we feast fans.
 I love you.
 Y'all are the best.
 Sean, I know there's nothing more iconic
 than the Chicago hot dog.
 So guess what?
 I'm turning it into a burger today, buddy.
 (bottle pops)
 Is it a hot dog?
 Is it a burger?
 Who cares?
 It's the holidays.
 All right, y'all, let's get started.
 Check this out.
 I'm subbing out the hot dog.
 I'm taking the hot dog out.
 I'm taking the glizzy out.
 And we're subbing it with a burger shaped like a hot dog.
 (bell rings)
 So we ground this meat fresh today.
 It's chuck, brisket, rib eye, a bunch of steak trim.
 We'll season this with salt.
 You just throw it on just like you would a hot dog.
 Boom.
 This is kind of like kebab-y, you know?
 So it makes sense.
 I'm not the only one who's doing this.
 This makes sense.
 That looks fire.
 Poppy seed bun, staple for a Chicago dog.
 And you're just gonna drape it over the burger like this,
 just so that it could get nice and warm.
 I'm gonna pull this off just like that.
 Let's Chicago dog this up.
 So what I noticed in Chicago is there's always
 a whole pickle spear, and it's always faced like that.
 I'm gonna transfer this to my hot dog tray.
 We're gonna add a little bit of heat
 and a little bit more acid with jardin air.
 Then we're gonna add relish for the sweetness.
 Let's top it with a couple of these chilies.
 And last but not least,
 you can't forget a couple shakes of celery salt.
 Chicago style burger dog for you, buddy.
 Mistletoe.
 I'll be your taste buds.
 There's nothing wrong with that.
 That is delicious.
 That is fantastic.
 What the hell is this?
 Oh, you guys, you shouldn't have.
 Ooh, I love gifts, man.
 What?
 Bro.
 Burger phone.
 I've always wanted one of these.
 Y'all are the best.
 The best team in the world.
 Happy holidays.
 I love you.
 Thank you.
 Oh, I gotta take this call.
 Nicole, take it away.
 - Happy holidays, everybody.
 I'm Nicole Russell from Pizza Wars.
 And today I'm gonna teach you how to make Spincione.
 Spincione is also known as Sicilian Christmas pizza
 or Sicilian New Year's pizza.
 For this, I wanted a highly hydrated dough
 because I want it to be light, airy, and crispy.
 This is what your dough should look like,
 stretched out to the corner, a little bubbly.
 What I'm gonna do with this Spincione dough
 is I'm gonna par bake it so it can support the toppings.
 Okay, so my dough is par baked.
 So I got my own secret recipe sauce here.
 No, you can't know what's in it.
 For Spincione, you can go all the way
 to the edge with your sauce.
 We're gonna add some anchovies,
 and this is gonna pack a lot of flavor.
 You wanna put a liberal amount of breadcrumbs
 so it soaks up all the sauce,
 and that's what really makes a good Spincione.
 So we're using traditional Cacio e Vallo cheese.
 This is like a harder cheese than the average mozzarella,
 and it has a little bit more sharpness to it.
 So right now we're all set.
 This is traditional, right?
 You can leave it right here, but why?
 I'm gonna put some onions on top of here.
 These are some caramelized onions.
 And now I'm gonna add a little green
 because it's Christmas, so let's go.
 We're gonna add a little bit of green olives to this.
 We went all around the edges.
 We're being really generous with our toppings.
 So nothing left to do but to throw it in the oven
 and bake this for about 10 minutes.
 You can see what happened in the oven.
 The breadcrumbs got nice and toasty.
 It's gonna be good.
 Are you dreaming of a white Christmas?
 I am.
 So we got our little crispy booty on the bottom.
 That's what we want.
 All the sauce and the breadcrumbs go to the edge.
 So good.
 I wanna take a bite.
 Is that all right with you?
 Okay, let's go.
 Mm.
 Oh my God.
 You're gonna love this.
 Do this ASAP.
 Super easy to make at home, not complicated at all.
 Don't stress yourself out.
 It's Christmas.
 And yes, please don't forget to hit that donation button.
 Happy holidays from the First Sweet Peas family
 and yours.
 Mwah.
 Look how cute.
 I am surprised.
 Oh my God, what's this?
 Oh, I wonder what it is.
 Oh my goodness.
 I love it.
 Pizza earrings.
 Thank you so much.
 I'm putting them on.
 I love them for real, but thank you.
 Oh, is it mine?
 It's a prop.
 Oh no, no, no.
 (laughing)
 I got an ax 'cause I still don't got a trophy.
 Thank you so much.
 That was so much fun.
 Now let's see what George is cooking up in his kitchen.
 - Thanks Nicole.
 Welcome to the Burger Scholar headquarters,
 holiday edition.
 (mimics bird calling)
 Mm.
 As you can tell, I'm the kind of guy
 who goes all out for the holidays.
 I love the holidays.
 The party is here.
 I get to dress up.
 I get to pull out my fake white tree and light it up.
 I get to drink eggnog,
 but I also get to make you a burger.
 And not just any burger,
 the tortilla burger from New Mexico.
 We're going full Christmas on you.
 That's right, Christmas.
 It's a locals only term
 for when you want red and green together on the same plate.
 Christmas.
 See what I did there?
 (mimics bird calling)
 Okay.
 Let's do this.
 One of the elements is a very large flour tortilla.
 I'm gonna heat it up a little bit.
 Just get a little hot.
 Give me two pieces of parchment paper.
 This should be,
 aye, no, that's not smart.
 Hang on.
 Burger's down.
 The burrito, the burrito.
 We've got warm, green fried beans.
 We also have warming on here,
 red and green chili from New Mexico.
 They have two very different flavors.
 One is very bright,
 and the other one's very smoky and deep.
 You put these two together,
 you have absolute like New Mexican cuisine magic.
 Flipping.
 Okay.
 Re-fried beans.
 Smear that in.
 Cheddar cheese on top of the refried beans.
 The patty goes on top of that.
 We wrap it up.
 But we're not done yet.
 On top of this goes red and green chili.
 Happy holidays.
 On top of that,
 cheddar cheese again.
 More cheddar on top.
 And then this goes into the broiler.
 Here you go.
 Oh, you got it.
 (upbeat music)
 Ah.
 It's a New Mexican tortilla burger.
 Oh my God.
 (laughs)
 Smells so good.
 Oh, knife and fork.
 (claps)
 (laughs)
 Knife and fork.
 Mm, that's hot.
 Mm.
 That's good.
 Oh wow, that's good.
 (laughs)
 If you live in New Mexico,
 green chili and red chili pretty much goes on everything.
 Why not on a burger?
 Happy holidays.
 Mm.
 - From the first We Feast family and for the holidays,
 we got you a little gift.
 - Okay.
 Is it gonna explode in my face?
 Is it hot?
 Oh, it's a cactus?
 The fuck is this thing?
 Jesus Christ.
 Is it alive?
 Is it animals?
 Thank you for my new aloe plant.
 - It's for all the burns.
 - Oh, got it.
 It's for all the burns.
 Oh yeah.
 Oh, look at that.
 Oh, for the burns.
 Oh yeah.
 Thank you for this perfect holiday gift.
 Back to you, Sean.
 - Wow, a hot dog hamburger.
 It's so beautiful, it could make a grown man cry.
 And now it's time to really turn on the waterworks
 as we present the first ever Hot Ones Awards.
 Looking back on the history of the show,
 who's gonna take home the lifetime achievement?
 Who had the biggest meltdown?
 Who had the best wing 10?
 Will any of our illustrious guests add an H to their EGOT?
 I guess only time will tell.
 And there's no one better to help shepherd us
 through this momentous ceremony
 other than my guy, Camera Guy Bill.
 Camera Guy Bill, take it away.
 ♪ Wadidadida ♪
 ♪ It's the Hot Ones Awards ♪
 ♪ It's the spiciest, the mightiest ♪
 ♪ The Hot Ones Awards ♪
 ♪ There'll be celebrities, golden amenities ♪
 ♪ The Hot Ones Awards ♪
 - Thank you for that wonderful introduction, Sean.
 Welcome one and all to the first ever Hot Ones Awards show.
 This is a celebration of your favorite moments
 and memories of Hot Ones past and present.
 The Hot Ones Academy has been hard at work
 rewatching 16 seasons worth of celebrities
 taking on the 10-wing gauntlet
 and picking award-worthy moments.
 And let me tell you something,
 the Academy takes this very seriously.
 We've curated a list of categories and nominees
 that really brought the heat.
 And it's about time they get some recognition
 in the form of a custom-made golden hot sauce bottle.
 Look at her, what a beauty.
 So without further ado, let's get to our first award.
 We've had some of the most talented musicians
 in the world at our table,
 and every now and again, the winds of death
 give us an impromptu show of a lifetime.
 These are the nominees for the Best Musical Moment.
 Russell Brands, ode to superfan Brett Baker.
 T-Pain, singing into a toy T-Pain microphone.
 John Mayer, playing the ukulele.
 And the winner is T-Pain!
 Congratulations, Mr. T-Pain!
 - What's good, guys?
 This is your homeboy, T-Pain.
 First and foremost, I wanna say thank you to Hot Ones,
 everybody over there, Sean Evans,
 the Spice Kings, everybody that made this happen
 'cause you guys have had a ton of great guests,
 especially musical ones.
 So I'm glad I got the musical moment
 because I'm just better than everybody.
 So that's how it works.
 Suck it, everybody else.
 I'm putting this right next to the Grammys.
 Thank you guys again, and yeah, let's do it again.
 Just spicier.
 - I got a burp coming, but I don't know where it is.
 I feel it, okay.
 Here at Hot Ones, we have been known to ask celebrities
 to do one final task before we send them home.
 Some task harder than the others,
 and some tasks we don't even ask them to do.
 Here are the nominees for Best Wing 10 Moment.
 Babish, getting a Hot Ones tattoo.
 Logic, finishing a Rubik's Cube.
 Stevo, chucking a bottle of hot sauce
 and then putting it in his eye.
 And the winner is Stevo.
 - Hi, I'm Stevo.
 And when I first found out I was gonna be on Hot Ones,
 I was so stoked, man.
 I thought, dude, I'm a star.
 And now to be presented with this Hot Ones
 Best Wing 10 Moment award, whatever that means.
 It's just an honor beyond belief, thank you.
 - A shooting star you are, Stevo.
 And adios, is that a hard wing 10 to watch.
 Get it?
 Aye, adios, meo.
 Ah, you know, yeah, okay, let's go.
 Speaking of doing something crazy,
 we've watched our sauces take down
 their fair share of celebrities over the years.
 Some a bit more gracefully than others.
 Here are the nominees for Biggest Meltdown.
 Tyra Banks, switch with the cameraman.
 Eric Andre, laying down on his couch.
 Eddie Huang, eating wing 10 first.
 And the winner is, Miguel Tyra Banks.
 - I can't believe that I won
 the most entertaining reaction award.
 This is amazing.
 I wanna thank everybody, especially camera man, Bill.
 You just couldn't have done this without you.
 And I wish I could say I'm crying, but really,
 I can't stop eating a lot of wings.
 And I can't stop,
 soothing it with ice cream.
 But now it's my ice cream.
 (laughs)
 - From camera guy, Bill, to camera man, Bill.
 Thanks Tyra.
 I certainly wouldn't be here
 if it wasn't for that meltdown.
 Congratulations.
 Now, while some guests might not be able
 to handle their spice,
 we've also seen our fair share of guests come in
 and handle the wings like a true champion.
 Not even breaking a sweat.
 Here are the nominees for wing warrior.
 Charlize Theron,
 Lord,
 Halle Berry.
 And the winner is, Charlize Theron.
 Come on down.
 - Hi.
 Hi guys.
 Oh my God.
 Thank you.
 It's so heavy.
 It's like, it's like, it's heavier than the Oscar.
 This is amazing.
 This is actually better than the Oscar
 'cause my kids are not impressed by my Oscar.
 And I think this will really impress them.
 I mean, look at that.
 That is so awesome.
 Yeah, motherfuckers.
 Apparently I can deal with some spice.
 So there you go.
 Sean, I love being on your show.
 Every time I come on, it's my favorite part of the day.
 And I hope we get to do it soon, again.
 And I'm really touched by this, you guys.
 Honestly, it's been a while since I've won anything.
 So sending you guys a hot kiss make-out session.
 It's coming over.
 Here it comes.
 - Well, Charlize, saying that award means more
 than your Oscar is one of the greatest achievements
 of my life.
 Speaking of achievements, I think it's about time
 we introduce our first ever Hot Ones Lifetime
 Achievement Award.
 This award goes to the person or persons
 who have given us so much quality content over the years.
 From their episodes at the table,
 to their episodes in their homes,
 and who could forget Truth or Dab?
 These two guys have a special place in our channel
 and in our hearts.
 I give you Tom Segura and Burt Kreischer.
 - Sean, Spice Lords, everybody at Hot Ones,
 Burt and I are thrilled to receive our
 Lifetime Achievement Award.
 It's about my favorite show ever to exist on the internet.
 Sean, you're the greatest and we both are big fans
 of hot sauce.
 - Yeah, I think in our weight loss journey,
 our hot sauce has meant so much to both of us.
 So thank you so much for awarding this to us.
 I'm through the roof.
 Is our hot sauce in there?
 - Yeah, ready?
 - For real?
 - Yeah.
 - Well, I don't even know what to say to that one.
 All I know is next year I'm hosting this without my shirt.
 Thanks Burt.
 Well, there you have it Spice Lords,
 the first ever Hot Ones Awards.
 Thank you to all our winners and nominees
 for giving these great moments.
 I cannot wait for more celebrity reactions
 and memories to come.
 You're all winners in my heart.
 Oh wait, wait, I'm being told that I missed one award.
 The most creative antidote award.
 Well, I think you all know who won that.
 I mean, he came with a Mary Poppins bag full of goodies
 and I'm told he brought even more this time.
 Well, I guess I shouldn't keep you waiting any longer.
 Ladies and gentlemen, back for round two
 versus the wings of death,
 our grand finale to the holiday extravaganza,
 it's Gordon Ramsay.
 Hey, what's going on everybody?
 At long last, we've reached the finale
 of the Hot Ones Holiday Extravaganza.
 And let me tell you something,
 we are doing it big to close things out.
 A man who needs no introduction on this channel whatsoever,
 the 100 million view man, chef Gordon Ramsay,
 welcome back to the Hot Ones experience.
 First of all, my fucking ring's still on fire.
 Everywhere I go, it's not about MasterChef
 or Hell's Kitchen, it says, we love the fucking Hot Ones.
 How hot were they?
 That's amazing.
 Yeah, good to be back.
 Merry Christmas.
 They told me there would be some surprises today.
 I'm done eating shit food.
 Okay.
 If we're gonna do this thing again,
 we need to have a proper motherfucking wing.
 Last time I told you, I'm not eating that dry shit
 from granddad's toenails to fucking bits of unwanted quail.
 They are shit.
 In here is a wing.
 I'm talking about a three-mixing style wing,
 a wing with elegance.
 And when you open the box, you're gonna be surprised
 'cause first of all, chicken lollipops.
 If we're gonna celebrate the return
 to this incredible competition yet again,
 trust me, I want to eat some fucking chicken.
 Well, I guess this means though
 that we're dressing them ourselves.
 Yes.
 So you just, what are you doing?
 You're covering?
 Yeah, got a little cover.
 Whoa!
 Okay.
 Everyone said last time, especially my son Jack,
 said, "Dad, there wasn't that much sauce on there,
 was there?"
 I said, "Dude, let me tell you,
 there was enough sauce on there."
 I swear to God, my ring's still bleeding.
 Right, how nice is that to hold a wing with some elegance?
 It's lovely.
 Three Michelin star lollipop right here.
 There you go.
 Right.
 (gentle music)
 So before we get too deep into the interview,
 I want to do a quick post-mortem
 on the fateful day that was almost three years ago
 where you walked in with a Mary Poppins bag
 of spicy food antidotes and left us
 with one of the biggest interviews
 in the history of the internet.
 What's the fan feedback been like for you on the street
 ever since that aired?
 There's probably not a day that goes by
 where someone doesn't ask me about it.
 I think the most exciting for me
 was just how young those demos go
 in terms of 12-year-olds saying,
 "Hey, will you go back on there again?"
 And I'm like, "No, what's the fucking why?"
 And you go, "No, sorry, no, I won't."
 Everywhere I go, honestly, from the arse end of Honduras
 to a jungle in Guyana.
 And I'm about to rappel out of a helicopter 250 foot down
 and the pilot, okay, is trying to talk to me
 about the third question on Hot Ones.
 I'm like, "Dude, I'm hanging off this fucking helicopter
 from my ball bag.
 You're about to unleash me onto a sector of this river
 and there's alligators down there.
 I'll discuss the Hot Ones in a fucking minute."
 He was more interested in the fucking Hot Ones
 than getting me safe on the ground.
 That's how popular this competition has become.
 How many F-bombs, if you had to guess,
 do you think you dropped during that interview?
 And then we'll put the real number next to your guess here.
 Well, you were winding the shit out of me.
 You were winding me up so you were sort of,
 you were being very provocative.
 It was my fault, it was my fault.
 And fucks, first time round, 35.
 35 might be underselling it just a little bit,
 but we'll compare that to the real number.
 Are you ready to move on here to the next sauce?
 No, I need to show you what's inside my sack.
 Sure, sure.
 Literally inside my sack.
 So, just.
 Ooh.
 He's got more antidotes.
 I am so fucking organized.
 You've got no idea.
 Now.
 That cools everything right down.
 And just in time.
 And now all that heat is disappearing, okay?
 I feel like I've just kissed the fucking Sahara Desert
 'cause my mouth is stuck together,
 but that is way smoother now.
 So I've lined my palate.
 So next time round with that sauce,
 it won't be so pungent, I promise.
 That's a big jump from the first one.
 Last time around, we did a 10-wing gauntlet.
 Here, it's a five-wing gauntlet, which is nice, fewer wings,
 but the ramp up, much more vertical.
 Back into the sack.
 It's Christmas, so.
 (laughs)
 I'm gonna do a beautiful little, just like.
 Wow.
 A sort of a cocktail, right?
 This is amazing.
 And also, it's festive.
 Now this is gonna cool that thing down, okay?
 Do all your guests come on with gifts like this?
 No, you know, you've really set a trend here.
 And also, you need to come prepared, right?
 Oh, you brought the lemon and the lime back.
 Of course I did.
 Here we go.
 Now, look at that.
 That is a beautiful cocktail.
 Cheers, my man. Cheers.
 Merry fucking Christmas. Merry Christmas.
 That's very nice.
 So you like that, don't you? I do.
 It's like a citrusy, sort of piña colada situation.
 That's exactly that, and the cooling element.
 Are your eyes getting a bit watery,
 or just getting tearful 'cause it's Christmas?
 Well, listen, I've got a lot of mileage on me, Gordon.
 Ever since you sat here,
 I've probably shot another 150 episodes
 since I saw you last.
 I'm wearing down.
 I get asked by chefs all over the world, is he that good?
 It's Sean Evans.
 I said, he's the real fucking deal, let me tell you.
 He's winning as a shit, but the questions are great.
 So last time you were on the show,
 we hit you with some viral food creations,
 including sushi donuts,
 which you remarked must have come out of Portland.
 So given the success of that segment,
 what I want to do is bounce a few general food topics
 off of you, just to get from Chef Gordon Ramsay,
 are they overrated, are they underrated, and why?
 In and out.
 Delicious.
 I mean, really delicious.
 Animal style.
 Yeah, really smart.
 Hand-cut chips.
 The drive-through is extraordinary,
 except I have to crawl through the fucking window
 every time to do selfies with them and turn around.
 And then they say, it's on me.
 I said, no, no, I need to pay for it.
 No, no, it's on me now, I'm gonna pay for this thing.
 So in and out, worth it, 100%, yeah, beautiful.
 Nando's.
 Nando's, Tilly, our youngest daughter,
 is obsessed with Nando's.
 Truthfully, between you and I, the kids have been,
 I've never been to a fucking Nando's.
 Wow. Ever.
 What about truffle oil?
 Truffle oil, yeah.
 Pungent, overrated, and chefs use it like vinaigrette.
 It needs to be put in a pipette.
 It needs to be dropped into a vinaigrette
 and then mixed throughout.
 And so when you've got amazing alba truffles,
 perigot truffles, okay, enhance that season.
 Don't spoil it.
 Any chef that sticks truffle oil on top of truffles
 is a fake bastard because let the truffles
 aspire to be what they should be.
 Oh, excuse me, second wing in.
 That shit's already regurgitated.
 A $12 bottle.
 Here's the issue.
 Everyone's obsessed with summer truffles.
 The worst truffle on the planet.
 They look like a truffle, they taste like shit.
 Truffles should be eaten for six, seven weeks a year,
 and then we say goodbye to it.
 So to go from the beautiful white truffles in the winter,
 perigot truffles through February, March,
 and then to go to summer truffles,
 we're missing the fucking point.
 Summer truffles taste like a mouth of fucking sawdust.
 Wow.
 Coupled with a touch of that first set of wings
 you gave me a few years back,
 the ones that look like my granddad's toenails.
 Stay away from summer truffles.
 They taste of nothing.
 So that is very, very fragrant.
 Whoa.
 Smells delicious.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my lits.
 Santa's got a big sack.
 He's got a massive sack.
 I'm fapping flashbacks.
 Oh, what is this?
 Is that not hot for you?
 Yeah, it is hot, it is hot,
 but I think I'm distracted by what's going on.
 Whoa!
 (laughing)
 (sighing)
 Shit.
 What the fuck is in that thing?
 And I'm back.
 Jesus Christ almighty.
 Shit.
 Come on.
 (laughing)
 This is not normal.
 You're not fucking normal.
 That shit's unedible.
 I swear to God.
 Holy fuck, it's still burning.
 Is that only number three?
 Only number three, only number three.
 Shit, my fucking boots.
 I don't know what you have left in that sack,
 but this next one's crazy.
 (coughing)
 Shit.
 I know, I know.
 What is that?
 That is, it's just the straight bootle of fire.
 Shit, my fucking boots, man.
 With some kick, with some kick, with some kick.
 With some kick.
 Of all the cooking demonstrations
 that you've done on your YouTube channel or on talk shows,
 is there a celebrity guest that's really impressed you
 with their skills in the kitchen?
 (coughing)
 First of all, it's not fucking Sean Evans.
 (laughing)
 Have you made that scrambled egg yet?
 You know what, it's forever changed
 the way that I make scrambled eggs.
 I love it with that creme fraiche.
 You changed my life with that.
 Shit.
 Sorry.
 Fucking hell.
 Okay.
 (laughing)
 Shit.
 Fuck.
 Fuck me.
 That is not normal.
 That should come with a health warning on the side.
 Well, wait till you have the next one.
 We had an extraordinary moment at Royal Osso Road
 where Bradley Cooper was filming Burnt.
 And so we had a couple of dinners together
 and he just wanted to get into the mind of that chef
 'cause it was going from a two star to a three star.
 What did it take?
 Sadly, we've had chefs that have committed suicide
 based on being told they were gonna lose
 a certain point for a guy.
 I say to young chefs, you lose everything in life,
 dust yourself down, win it back.
 It's only a star.
 And it's like the Champions League.
 You're gonna be in that mix next year.
 So don't take your life because of a fucking guy.
 Don't be so stupid.
 And so halfway through the second dinner we had together,
 in fact, he came over to the house for dinner
 and all of a sudden I started seeing plate food.
 And I was thinking, Christ, he's only been in production
 for six weeks.
 He's working so hard at this.
 And now he's sounding like a chef.
 And some actors act it and some actors do it
 and act it out brilliantly.
 He actually got into the head space of a chef
 and understood what a mind fuck they are
 and how competitive they are.
 And that was a beautiful shock for me
 to witness someone working that hard across a movie.
 And boy, I mean, it showed
 'cause he came across brilliantly.
 Fucking nose is running again.
 Why'd you do this to me?
 (laughing)
 Shit.
 'Cause it's so much fun every time you're here, Gordon.
 This next one is the Bomb Beyond Insanity.
 You might remember it from when you were on the show.
 Okay.
 So the bottle looks super dangerous.
 Yeah.
 How hot is this on a scale of one to 10?
 12.
 Oh shit.
 This one.
 Ooh, okay.
 Small dabs on this one.
 Small dabs.
 And it's called the Bomb.
 Is this one of yours again?
 No, no, this one is not mine.
 This one is not mine.
 I do not claim it.
 I do not condone it.
 I do not endorse it.
 Look how dark it is.
 Yeah.
 So that's rich, isn't it?
 That is very rich.
 Jeez.
 Be very careful.
 Be very careful.
 Fuck me, no.
 That's just fucked my wing.
 Yeah.
 'Cause that has obliterated my wing.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I might as well be eating
 the Flay's fucking appetizers.
 Obliterate.
 That is fucking disgusting.
 I kid you not.
 Obliterated my mouth too.
 Did you like that?
 No, no, no.
 Just for this part of the show, but thankfully we got.
 So bread, a little bit of milk, soak it.
 Squeeze down.
 And the bread will absorb all those fucking spices.
 Okay.
 Wash that palette.
 There we go.
 I think I'm back.
 I think I'm back.
 I'm way over.
 It's gonna sound super strong.
 I wasn't gonna get fucking taken down
 and fucking fourth bottle in.
 That thing is, man, that's powerful that.
 Yeah.
 And it's called the Bomb.
 Yeah, you actually had it last time you were on the show.
 That one really?
 Yeah.
 And does that come with like a sort of
 bowl of toilet paper?
 It should.
 'Cause you would absolutely shit yourself
 on the way home with that thing.
 Christ almighty.
 They should have you curate a little first aid kit
 that goes along with the sauce.
 Beyond insanity on the bottle.
 It is way beyond insanity.
 How much is that?
 This one?
 That's probably eight to 10 bucks situation right there.
 Fuckin' shit.
 (laughing)
 So.
 On this wing, what we wanna do is
 introduce a food element.
 Don't worry, we're not gonna be making scrambled eggs again.
 But I wanna lean on your British roots
 to get a little crash course in puddings.
 I'll just bounce a pudding off you.
 You tell me what it is and the best time to eat it.
 Yeah.
 Spotted dick.
 Spotted dick is a traditional sponge
 that is steamed with tiny raisins.
 And it's an old fashioned English dessert
 that comes out in this sort of,
 well it's like a dick shaped sponge.
 And you slice it and you're supposed to serve
 it a little bit of butter traditionally.
 Sticky toffee pudding.
 Sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorites.
 That's with a puree of dates
 and you make this incredible sponge
 and then you soak it in this toffee and it's delicious.
 Especially with something like a salted caramel ice cream.
 I can taste fuck all now by the way.
 Yeah, I know.
 It takes me three or four days.
 I know you think I'm fucking around.
 I brush my teeth every fucking hour
 when I finish this show.
 And then I swirl that fucking Lister mint.
 Yeah, that just obliterates and it still numbs it.
 So, no, not good.
 Listen, welcome to my world.
 That's how I feel 24/7.
 And then I understand that with a Christmas pudding,
 it's kind of tradition for people to hide coins in it
 or different little prizes.
 So we've given you a Christmas pudding
 and you have a little spoon.
 We have a little present in there for you.
 You're not the only one bringing gifts today.
 That's very kind.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 (laughing)
 Are you fucking serious?
 The boss.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, that's out of fucking order.
 Come on, man.
 Jesus Christ.
 All right, Gordon Ramsay.
 (coughing)
 (dramatic music)
 (coughing)
 Oh, shit.
 I didn't know whether to sneeze, fart or piss myself.
 (laughing)
 I've got stuff caught at the top of my nose now.
 How do I get that back down?
 We're just forever changed, I think.
 Jesus Christ.
 Baptized by hot sauce.
 This is the last dab.
 We call it the last dab 'cause it's tradition around here
 to put a little extra on the last wing.
 You don't have to if you don't want to.
 Just two seconds.
 I brought you a fucking present.
 I brought you a present too.
 Now fuck yourself, I'm gonna take it back now.
 I said you should have pot some pans.
 Fuck it, I'm taking them home to my mom.
 Whoa.
 I am not fucking around for this last one.
 I have got my shit together.
 Fuego blaster?
 Right, sauce.
 Where were we?
 The last dab.
 Okay, light dab.
 Little light dab, little light dab.
 Boo.
 Excuse me.
 Shit.
 I never burp or belch like that.
 Motherfucker.
 Yeah, it brings it out of you, this show.
 My stomach's all hot.
 My armpits are fucking sweating.
 I know, you know, I was so excited to see you today
 and you to see me and then I feel like
 you probably don't want to see me for a while after this.
 Christmas!
 Okay!
 Fuck!
 No...
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 I just can't eat that.
 My very own line of Pepto Bismol.
 No, it is Pepto.
 No.
 No.
 Fucking hell.
