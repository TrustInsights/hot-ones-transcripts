 Viola's last words before she died on the Hot Ones show was...
 (dramatic music)
 - Hey, what's going on everybody?
 For First We Feast, I'm Sean Evans
 and you're watching Hot Ones.
 It's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings.
 And today we're joined by Viola Davis.
 She's one of the most decorated actors of the 21st century
 from the Broadway stage to Emmy,
 an Academy Award winning performances in TV and film.
 Her memoir, "Finding Me" topped the best sellers list
 earlier this year and she has a brand new film
 on the way as well.
 The historical epic, "The Woman King",
 which is in theaters now.
 Viola Davis, welcome to the show.
 - Thank you.
 - How are you around spicy food before we get started?
 - You know, I grew up around spicy food.
 South Carolina, you know, you can't get hot enough.
 But you know, as I've aged,
 some things are going on my digestive system,
 but I'm hopeful.
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 (dramatic music)
 - Okay.
 (soft music)
 (soft music)
 (soft music)
 Oh my God.
 - Is that a good look?
 - Oh my, oh my goodness.
 Okay, I should pace myself, but this is so good.
 (laughing)
 Oh my goodness, just one more.
 Mm-hmm.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Oh my God.
 (soft music)
 (soft music)
 - So "The Woman King", which you've described
 as a black female led brave heart,
 tells the story of an all woman warrior army
 that fought to defend Africa's Dahomey kingdom
 in the 19th century.
 How do you break down the mechanics
 of shooting epic battle scenes
 at the size and scale that you see in this film?
 Like when you have hundreds and hundreds of extras on set,
 what is the atmosphere or environment like
 in the moments leading up to the director saying action?
 - The environment is just complete and total fear.
 Like when we shot the first village raid scene,
 that's what it's called.
 It was two o'clock in the morning.
 Okay, now I'm at the bone.
 (laughing)
 I'm just gonna suck it off the bone.
 - There you go.
 - I'm just gonna.
 - There you go, I'm in with you.
 - So it's fear.
 Because you have to like toss 200 and something pound men
 over your shoulder.
 You're with swords, you're trying not to get hurt.
 We trained five hours a day.
 - Wow.
 - And we did all the stunts ourselves, no CGI.
 It was all us.
 And sprinting at 9.410 on a treadmill by the way.
 And did I tell you I'm over 50?
 - Impressive.
 - You know, once you get up there in the heart rate,
 you lose oxygen.
 And the fact that I'm sitting here right now eating hot wings
 and I'm still alive is a testament
 to the training of this movie.
 - Same look.
 - It's so good.
 (laughing)
 Oh, so good.
 - We set such a high bar, I'm afraid I'm gonna disappoint you
 further down the line, you know?
 - You're not disappointing me so far, sir.
 - I love that, I love that.
 So in your memoir, Finding Me,
 you tell a story about auditioning at Juilliard
 in jeans and a sweater,
 while other hopefuls practice yoga poses
 and did ballet and Fitz Morris work while they waited.
 Thinking back on those days,
 what's an acting exercise or warmup technique
 that you've found to be actually helpful?
 And then can you give us another one
 that stands out in your mind
 because it's just, you know, kind of silly?
 - An acting exercise that's really helpful
 is a breathing exercise where you take a deep breath
 from your diaphragm and you sing a song
 like Happy Birthday, like,
 but you take it syllable by syllable.
 So say you take a breath,
 and then you really release,
 and you just let it all go, take another breath,
 and by the end, you're either laughing, crying, both,
 you're hyperventilating,
 but the reason why it's helpful
 is because it accesses your emotions.
 So I like that exercise.
 A lot of the rest put me right to damn sleep.
 Like when you have to lay on the floor
 and imagine yourself as an animal and all of that.
 Remember the first time I did that in class,
 this is at Juilliard,
 and I think they said, "Imagine that you're a cloud,"
 but I fell asleep during the damn exercise.
 So then I woke up and I thought that they said,
 "Imagine you're a plow."
 So then I woke up and everybody's like floating and floating.
 I'm like, "That doesn't look like a plow."
 So I started pretending I was a plow.
 So I was crawling around my all fours going,
 (imitates plowing)
 (laughs)
 And I remember the teacher coming up to me and saying,
 "Okay.
 "Okay.
 "This is interesting.
 "Just keep working on it though, okay?
 "Just keep working on it."
 I was like, "Oh, okay."
 (imitates plowing)
 So the rest of them, I don't know, you know.
 I'm telling you, I'm defying the odds right now.
 Smooth as a cucumber.
 - I love this one.
 I love this one.
 - This is so good.
 - So I want to stay on the topic of theater
 because when we had Kevin Bacon on the show,
 he talked about his time at the Circle in the Square Theater,
 which is a place that I know that you likewise thrived.
 What is the difference in the kind of training
 that you get there compared to like
 a prestigious conservatory like Juilliard?
 - Circle in the Square was more about you being honest,
 tapping into your emotion, tapping into the moment,
 you know, and Juilliard was more about technique,
 voice, speech, breathing, staying thin.
 But Juilliard was helpful.
 I feel like I give Juilliard a bad rap a lot of times.
 I'm surprised they haven't called me.
 (both laugh)
 But that was a difference.
 - From your one woman show where you did 17 different
 characters to early renditions of Hot El Baltimore,
 Romeo and Juliet, is there a student production
 that you think disproportionately shaped your ethos
 as an actor?
 - The one woman show, definitely.
 It really shaped me because there's nothing like being
 on stage by yourself.
 There's no one to sort of save you.
 There's no one to bounce off of except the audience.
 And I just thought I was bad ass back then, you know?
 Nothing had broken me down yet.
 I thought I was like really slick to just be this one actor,
 just performing all these characters,
 always got a standing ovation.
 I thought that was it, you know?
 - Well, I've got news for you Viola, still a bad ass.
 Look at you taking on this Hot Ones gauntlet, crushing it,
 taking everything down to the bone.
 Are you ready to move on here to sauce number four already?
 - Yes, I am.
 - I can see it.
 - You are not going to break me.
 (laughing)
 Oh my God.
 Oh my God.
 Did I tell you that back in the day,
 my husband's ex football player,
 they called him headache bow,
 'cause he could just, 'cause he'd say,
 I could rattle somebody's helmet,
 'cause if you kill the head, the body will die.
 He was a linebacker.
 And he said he would eat a dozen eggs,
 whole package of bacon,
 just to get big.
 He had a 52 inch chest.
 And I said, Julius,
 I could have out eaten you back in the day.
 (laughing)
 So that's what I say to you, I ain't out eating.
 - No arguments from this side of the table.
 (laughing)
 - What would you say is the biggest difference
 between a great TV show runner
 and then a great film director?
 - This is just my opinion now.
 - Let it fly, let it fly.
 - Do I need a cocktail?
 (laughing)
 Boy, if I had a cocktail, let me tell you something.
 That's what you need to change.
 - Dom in the kitchen.
 - You need a cocktail.
 A great show runner is going to lead the writers
 to always, the writing always has to,
 in my opinion, be consistent and just get better.
 That's very hard when you're doing a show
 of 22, 26 episodes.
 All of them have to be connected to the truth and life.
 That's what makes a good show runner.
 That's what makes a great film director.
 That's what makes a great teacher, life.
 And the more people recognize life on TV,
 on the stage, and all the collaborators
 that are involved in doing that,
 then you feel less alone as an audience member.
 And you do not forget the experience.
 It's tattooed in you, right?
 All right.
 - Mic drop.
 - Now let me suck on this damn bone.
 (laughing)
 Oh yeah.
 (laughing)
 I'm seeing the many faces of Viola
 through the Hot Ones gauntlet.
 - These are so good.
 - They are.
 - Oh my gosh.
 - You know, you can't taste it through the camera
 when you're watching the show,
 but so far at least a delicious meal.
 - Really good.
 - So Roger Ebert once wrote
 of your Academy Award nominated performance in "Doubt".
 It lasts about 10 minutes,
 but it's the emotional heart and soul of the film.
 What do you see as the opportunity for an actor
 when your performance is limited to a single scene?
 - See, I disagree with the term,
 there are no small roles, only small actors.
 Even though I understand exactly where it's coming from,
 there are some small roles.
 I had a line in "Caitlin Leopold"
 where I told Hugh Jackman's character,
 "Pick up your poop, pick up your dog's poop."
 And that was it.
 That's a small role.
 Mrs. Miller was not a small role,
 even though it was like one scene.
 It's written within an inch of its life.
 You know exactly who that woman is.
 The key is you always have to approach a character
 as if you're creating a human being.
 Who is she?
 What does she live for?
 What does she want based on what she needs in life?
 A need is always just a basic thing,
 like the need to love, the need to control,
 the need, I don't know, to heal.
 When you do all of that,
 and here's the last thing you gotta do,
 you gotta take a risk.
 So whatever you're thinking in your mind,
 make a bold choice,
 even if you think you're running in the wrong direction,
 make a choice so bold and so out there,
 and maybe it'll stick, or maybe you'll fail,
 which I've done a lot, but maybe it'll stick.
 And with that, I felt like I made a bold move,
 especially 'cause I was working opposite.
 - Meryl Streep. - Meryl Streep.
 And my nose was dripping.
 I'm scared.
 - Little bit of a different kind of look.
 - Yeah, it's just gum.
 - Steady hand. - Um-hmm.
 - Steady hand.
 - I'm a strong, I'm a OG warrior.
 - I know, I saw the movie, I know.
 - Mm-hmm. - I know.
 - You know what, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
 'cause you know what, I just swallowed the piece.
 (laughing)
 I'm going down the rabbit hole.
 - Yeah, walk it back.
 - You put me down the rabbit hole.
 - I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 - Yeah.
 - So in 2020, you executive produced
 and were featured in "Giving Voices,"
 a documentary that put a spotlight on six students
 as they competed for a chance
 to win the August Wilson monologue competition.
 - Mm-hmm.
 - Is there like a science to picking out
 the right audition monologue?
 Like is there a right or wrong way to do it?
 - I think so.
 I think that when you audition for something,
 I think that you should always pick a monologue
 that's closer to who you are.
 And I think you should always, and always too,
 and don't talk for too long.
 I know some people have monologues
 that just 10 minutes, nobody wants to sit 10 minutes.
 I think you got about three, four minutes at the most, okay?
 And here's the other thing, 'cause I always like,
 I'm gonna do my ceiling monologue last
 so I can blow their minds.
 I'll end with blowing their minds.
 That's bullshit.
 You start with your best monologue first
 so you get their attention right away.
 And I say that because I see it all the time.
 People say, "I'm gonna do King Lear."
 And you see them doing King Lear and you're like,
 "That's not good.
 And you're 20 years old, you're doing King Lear monologue.
 Don't do that shit."
 But I did Celie from "Color Purple"
 and Martine from "Learned Ladies."
 Martine was like, "Eh, eh."
 Looking back, I was like, "Uh, uh, uh."
 But there is a science.
 You do something dynamic.
 You wanna be memorable.
 You wanna wake people up.
 They've already seen 50 people before you.
 They don't wanna work at it.
 (dramatic music)
 I had to burp.
 Another level.
 But we're here.
 But we're here.
 You must have a hell of a liability clause.
 (laughing)
 'Cause people get it.
 I mean, you topple over after something like this.
 I know.
 So from what I gather about how you prepare
 to deliver an honest performance,
 it starts by gathering all of the facts.
 And then to quote,
 "If I don't think the scene is answering my questions,
 I'll bother the hell out of the director."
 Of the characters you've played,
 which one would you say had the biggest transformation
 or evolution from the way the character was written
 in the script to ultimately what materialized
 in the performance on screen?
 Annalise Keating for sure.
 That pilot that we shot,
 I remember 'cause it was my first sex scene.
 So, and I remember Billy Brown was who played Nate
 and he was my boyfriend.
 And I had a husband.
 So boyfriend, husband, which sounds really great
 until it comes time to shoot it.
 And we shot it.
 It was 12 degrees in Philadelphia.
 And she meets Nate and they have sex on top of the car,
 on the hood.
 Right outside of my house while my husband's in his office.
 (clears throat)
 Yeah.
 (laughs)
 You know, no disrespect,
 but I didn't believe that they wrote from a perspective
 of making her real.
 I just felt like she was coming from a past
 where there was trauma and sexual abuse.
 Ping, ping.
 So you see, you're painting the character.
 And then she changed her name.
 Why is she changing her name?
 Whoever she was, she hated.
 So there was a level of self-love that wasn't there.
 And juxtapose that with this bad-ass criminal defense attorney,
 then you start shaping a person.
 And so, but that kept like conversations
 had to keep happening for me to do that.
 So that's it.
 (burps)
 (laughs)
 (dramatic music)
 Fuck, I'm shaking.
 Me too.
 I know.
 Immediately.
 Nothing redeemable about it.
 (coughs)
 I know.
 (dramatic music)
 Nobody's ever whooped your ass
 after all these chicken wings.
 There've been some close calls.
 Nobody's said stop the camera,
 I'm gonna go over there and whoop your ass.
 When we had Idris Alba on,
 he stopped the show and goes, "Whose idea is it?"
 The creator, Chris Schoenberger,
 he actually traveled with us to London
 to shoot this episode.
 Idris, at that time, he goes, "Chris, can you fight?"
 Like he challenged Chris to a fight in the studio.
 And Chris is not here all the time,
 but he actually is here today.
 Oh my.
 Totally different level.
 So when we had David Harbour on the show,
 called Law and Order, the Dick Wolf subsidy for the arts,
 what do you see as the significance of law dramas
 and soap operas as like an endowment for performers?
 You gotta repeat that damn question.
 The thing about law dramas is
 it really challenges your process as an actor.
 It's hard to tap into emotion because...
 I know.
 I'm surprised I'm not pissing in my pants right now.
 I'm surprised it's not a puddle of piss right here.
 Well, I'm going down that damn rabbit hole so damn fast.
 I went from not...
 But anyway, when you're doing a courtroom scene,
 you have to pull out all your technique
 because a lot of it is just technical terms,
 but it has to be still dynamic, emotionally connected.
 And...
 And...
 You're working with so many different actors.
 You're working with the actors playing the judge,
 people who understand.
 You feel like you have more of an audience in the courtroom.
 And that's it, 'cause you know what?
 I can't talk anymore.
 I mean, my lips are burning off and I got some lips.
 Thanks, Rob.
 How can you say you're being my friend?
 I mean, you're a very lovely man and you're sort of cute too.
 But let me tell you something.
 I don't believe you.
 That this one's not as bad as the last one.
 No.
 I would never lie to you.
 I would never lie to you, Viola Davis.
 All right.
 So this is unique garlic here
 from Pucker Butt Pepper Company.
 Pucker Butt?
 It's no walk in the park,
 but a little bit easier than the last one.
 Did I tell you I had a panic attack once?
 No, you didn't tell me this.
 Meryl Streep, who's a very lovely woman, by the way,
 but she did something to me.
 She could not go to the first Critics Choice Award
 and she knew she was good.
 Some awards, you know, you're gonna win in advance.
 This is way back in the day.
 And she said, Viola, can you accept my award for me?
 I want you to do it 'cause I can't be there.
 I said, yeah.
 Oh my God, that's such an honor.
 Oh my God.
 Now I forgot that this was the first award show
 I had ever been to.
 I go to that award show
 and I proceed to have the worst panic attack.
 Just like I'm having right now
 when my legs couldn't stop moving,
 I began to cry.
 I literally could not move
 and I had to get up on that stage
 and accept the award from Meryl Streep.
 And guess what?
 What?
 She didn't tell me what to say.
 (laughing)
 So I'm saying that to you now because my legs are moving.
 Yeah.
 Well, the good news is
 we're almost to that finish line here.
 All right, Viola Davis.
 (dramatic music)
 I don't believe you with this one.
 You about 10 years down the rabbit hole.
 I didn't lie to you about the last one, did I?
 That tell you I have a really big husband
 that used to play football and ate 12 eggs a day.
 But he can swing a really good baseball bat.
 So you've been here.
 Is he here?
 Is he here?
 (laughing)
 Is that the look around?
 Keep my head on a swivel.
 (dramatic music)
 You do this one?
 Mm-hmm.
 It's not open.
 So I can do it?
 So you can't, you can't.
 You're in the clear.
 Mm-hmm.
 This is a hard one.
 They're all hard.
 They're all hard at this point, but we're there.
 I know.
 So we've hit the cliff notes on just a sliver
 of your amazing journey, but to close things out,
 I've heard you quote the famous mythologist Joseph Campbell.
 And as the saying goes,
 "The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are."
 What does that mean to you?
 Now we're about to get deep.
 Yep.
 While I'm choking to death.
 That's the show.
 Viola's last words before she died
 on the Hot Ones show was,
 I just feel like our whole journey in our life
 is becoming our ideal selves.
 You know, we get stripped away as we go along the journey.
 Where it's like, I've gotten to the point in my life,
 it's like, I've been sold a bill of goods.
 You know, that really at the end of the day,
 you come into this world, you are absolutely who you are.
 Then your parents come along
 and they try to imprint themselves on you,
 your friends, society, you know,
 this is a school you have to go to.
 This is how pretty you have to look.
 This is what you have to wear.
 And I think somewhere along the line
 is a voice deep within you
 that tells you exactly who you are.
 You just have to have the courage to do that.
 That's what the journey of the hero is all about.
 You know, you're born into a world where you don't fit in.
 And then you answer the call to adventure
 and you deny the call.
 And then at one point you then set out on your path.
 All right.
 And you slay dragons, you do all of that.
 And then at some point you come face to face
 with not a God, but yourself.
 Okay.
 And somewhere along the line, and you get it.
 Your aha moment, your elixir.
 And you go back to your ordinary world
 and you share it with others.
 And I think that's the journey.
 And I think that's the privilege
 of being absolutely who you are,
 belonging to yourself,
 and being brave.
 Slaying dragons.
 Slaying and I still got my lips. Conquering wings.
 Was it a battle against the spice
 or a battle against ourselves?
 Either way, Viola Davis, we came out on top
 and now there's nothing left to do
 but roll out the red carpet for you.
 This camera, this camera, this camera,
 let the people know what you have going on
 in your life.
 The Woman King, September 16th.
 See it in theaters.
 Agogi.
 Fusu.
 You'll see what I mean when you see the movie.
 (audience clapping)
 Oh my God.
 First of all, the wings are really good,
 but fantastic questions.
 Oh, well thank you so much.
 Are you an actor too?
 No, I've only played myself one time.
